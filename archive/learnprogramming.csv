I’ve always loved tech and was a gamer when I was younger. I wasn’t a programmer but I could google and Reddit through technical issues. I never called IT because I usually figured it out (I learned that’s why they liked me - I always had new stuff without asking for it). I wanted to make sure I could relate to my people, so I decided to do some homework on IT related stuff. My love of math and problem solving combined with undiagnosed adhd kicked in and I found myself in a Python course.

Became a bit obsessed because it felt natural. I am using AI to answer questions about why things operate the way they do and to assist, but only use it now for smaller blocks because it gets dumb really fast. I find myself correcting it when I get it to write blocks for me now.

Fast forward to the future. I’ve been building apps at work (mostly power apps, power automate - but learning Python made learning these EASY) and my database is now active. I’ve also built standalone tools with Python at work that are being used.

I’ve got no formal education in technology. But I clearly understand the concepts that have been introduced to me. I find myself now gravitating towards a career in technology. I could do this all day. Managing people is great when things are going well but……there’s downsides.

I guess I’m wondering what I should learn next to level up and make me valuable to a software development company? I’d even do simple things as a side hustle to level up my experience.

i'd watch a 3-hour course, nod along, feel like i understood it... but the second i opened vs code and tried to write real code? confused. why can't i use \`instanceof\` with an interface? why does my type annotation just... disappear?

realized the problem wasn't that i couldn't code. the problem is that typescript is weirdly invisible. it disappears at runtime (type erasure). you can't ""see"" it executing like you can with js console logs.

so i built a visualizer to show exactly what happens during compilation.

the interactive playground lets you:

* watch types fade away step-by-step as typescript compiles to javascript
* see interface declarations, parameter types, return types, and variable types all disappear
* understand why \`interface User\` literally doesn't exist in the browser

why this matters:

a lot of beginners try to use interfaces in if statements (e.g., \`if (user instanceof UserInterface)\`), not realizing that \`UserInterface\` literally doesn't exist at runtime. seeing it fade away visually helps that concept click.

i made a specific interactive lesson for this concept free to use (no signup required, just runs in browser).

if you're struggling to wrap your head around TS, try visualizing the compilation instead of just memorizing syntax. helps a ton.

My preferred ecosystem is the JavaScript ecosystem, TypeScript is my favorite language although I've learned a dozen languages over my tenure.

Before that I owned a business in an unrelated field for almost a decade before becoming an engineer in my late 20s and launching a startup.

I have some history with mentorship and I'm proud to say that I've helped some proteges find those first jobs. That isn't what I'm offering per-se however I'm feeling a bit of empty nest syndrome now since about a year ago, my most recent protege dropped out of the industry for personal reasons.

To be clear, I'm very busy and I'm only 1 person but I'm feeling an urge to help a few people out casually. Some things I'm interested in doing are a live stream on YouTube where people can jump into a discord room and we can do some pair programming or I can attempt to teach new concepts. I think it could be fun to take someone who knows almost no JavaScript and try to teach them the language.

I'd be interested in helping people debug problems they're stuck on.

I'm interested in this again because I'm worried that AI may be causing that programming muscle in my brain to atrophy a bit and I want to make sure I can still remember the basics that I've taken for granted for so long.

I'm not a good teacher, as in I don't have lesson plans, and teaching isn't a strong suit of mine, but I am passionate and I have a lot of experience.

I'm just trying to feel out the appetite for putting together an informal workshop that can be live streamed and establishing some new relationships in the process. I'd be open to project ideas. Maybe we can bootstrap a full-stack app and deploy it to Vercel together, I don't know exactly, I'm open to suggestions.

I do have a discord group that I started a few years back when I last made a reddit post similar to this and the group grew extremely fast. There are only about 5 people still active in it but they're all great people and love helping new developers too. I don't know if it is a violation to share the discord group in a post but if you're interested you can DM me and I can share it.

TO BE CLEAR- nothing here is monetized and there is no plan to ever monetize any of this. Not YouTube, not discord, not mentorship, I make a solid living doing work that I love. This is to keep me sharp and to try to chase the good feeling of knowing I've helped people to develop the superpower of programming.

I also have a few (soon to be) open source projects I've been casually working on. If anyone is interested in learning to contribute to open source, maybe we could find a way to do that with one of those projects. I'm just spitballing here. I'm open to any ideas but I want to kick of 2026 putting some positive energy out into the community"

2. Certifications (MongoDB & AWS): Since I work with Mongo heavily, should I aim for the Developer/Data Modeling certs and add AWS to the mix? Do these actually hold value for a junior dev in the current market?

I started The Odin Project a few days ago and quickly realized this is going to be a long-term commitment. That’s totally fine as long as it actually helps me grow.

My motivation is that I currently work in eCommerce managing a DTC Shopify site for a small to mid-size brand. I more or less fell into this role about a year ago. Most of my day-to-day work is in the Shopify admin: running promos, managing content, and making simple UI changes. For bigger changes in Liquid or more complex development work, we rely on an external agency.

Over the last few months, I’ve started poking around the theme code myself and using AI and other resources to make small UI tweaks. I don’t always know exactly what I’m doing. It’s made me realize that I could be a much bigger asset if I understood both how to run a store and how the code behind it actually works.

My question is: will The Odin Project realistically help me pivot into a Shopify web developer role, or do employers usually expect a more traditional computer science background? I only have a business degree and SQL experience.

Is there another online resource that would be better? I'd love to hear from anyone who’s made a similar transition.

but very proud that I have even managed to get this far lol, (debugging hell 200%)

Uses NASM and Golink in the backend.

Has anybody else ever done anything similar? Any advice?
Ive learned so much so far that im already contemplating restarting haha
Written in C++, managed to get these features:

Function definitions and calling
Global and local variables definitions
Integer mathematics that follow BEDMAS (Use shunting yard algorithm), can also nestle functions in the expressions
Can link to external dll for more functionality
The string types are = \[4bytes - length, 4bytes - capacity, 8 bytes - pointer\] and also null terminated, for working with C style string functions one can use the syntax $stringVariable.c

Here is an example that I managed to sucesfully compile today:

    #inc: ""core.ni""

    #def: $text   : string = ""This strings length = %d, capacity = %d\n""
    #def: $number : int32  = 95

    #def: .main() int32
    {
    .c_printf( $text.c, $text.length, $text.capacity )

    $number = 50*11

    .c_printf( ""Number (50*11) is: %d\n"", $number )

    $number = .getNumber()

    .c_printf( ""Number after function is: %d\n"", $number )

    .c_printf(""Enter a number: "")

    .exit(0)
    }

    #def: .getNumber() int32
    {
    .return(123456789)

And here is the ""core.ni""

    #lnk: ""msvcrt.dll""
    #ext: .c_printf : printf( $text  : pntr , $arg1 : any , $arg2 : any , $arg3 : any  )  void
    #ext: .c_scanf  : scanf( $text : pntr , $arg1 : pntr ) void
    #ext: .c_malloc : malloc( $size  : int32 ) pntr
    #ext: .c_free   : free( $address : pntr ) void
    #ext: .c_realloc: realloc( $address : pntr, $size : int32 ) pntr

    #lnk: ""kernel32.dll""
    #ext: .exit : ExitProcess($code : int32) void

Wanted to make linking to external functions easy! (I think this is fairly simple)

I try to take part in almost every opportunity I get.

The biggest benefit for me has been the exposure. You meet new people, work with different teams, and learn new things beyond regular classroom coding. Hackathons improve not just coding skills, but also communication, collaboration, and networking. You also get to know about new platforms, tools, and technologies, which is really helpful. What makes hackathons exciting is the experience of solving a real-world problem within a limited time — whether it’s a 24-hour or 36-hour hackathon. Thinking of an idea, building a solution from scratch, and implementing it under pressure is challenging but incredibly fun and rewarding.

Overall, the experience is top-notch and honestly enjoyable. I personally recommend college students to participate in hackathons along with their regular studies. They help improve coding knowledge, problem-solving skills, creative thinking, and even leadership skills.

For me, hackathons have been one of the most valuable parts of my college journey."

I think I understand the fundamental concepts of programming structure and some data-structures and maybe algorithms, but have a difficulty understanding the implementation side, as most sites just give the full implementation not really showing the step by step procedure to go about implementing.
I mostly know C as that was taught in school, but I feel most places don’t use it anymore so I’m trying to get use to C++, but the STL libraries kinda get overwhelming as theres many different functions and I think its more abstract so sometimes its difficult understanding the underlying code from it"

I already have a good foundation in Python and I’m preparing early for Google Summer of Code–style open-source contributions.

I want to invest time in ONE additional language that:
- Is commonly used in active open-source projects
- Allows faster onboarding and meaningful contributions
- Is useful long-term beyond just interviews

I’m considering Go, Rust, and Java.

I’d really appreciate advice from developers who have contributed to open source or mentored students:

It is a completely different world where the problems aren't about HTTP requests or CSS; they are about high-frequency execution, mathematical modeling, and processing massive amounts of data in real-time. It made me realize how many deep technical niches we completely ignore because they aren't as ""loud"" as web development.

I wanted to share this because if you are starting to feel a bit burnt out or bored with standard web stacks, I really encourage you to look at these non-obvious fields. Whether it is Quant, Embedded Systems, or Bio-informatics, there are rabbit holes out there that are way more technically challenging than the standard paths.

\- should be completable within a couple weeks

\- should be easily testable (ideally not too much reliance on graphics)

\- should require the use of classes and objects to build it efficiently in order to demonstrate to students the usefulness of these concepts

Some examples of ideas I do not like:

\- to-do list: this is so boring

\- pet adoption system: this is just a simulation of what a system like this would be like to code. It’s of no actual use to anybody

\- chatbot: a great project, but doesn’t require object oriented principles

\- video game: I would love to do this, but it would be rather difficult to write thorough tests for

I’m looking for good learning resources (books, articles, courses, videos, blog series, etc.) that focus on the *underlying mechanics of web development*, rather than on specific frameworks or how to write code. I’m currently working as a working student at a software company, and most of my day-to-day work is focused on implementing features and writing code. While this is valuable experience, I don’t really get the opportunity to deeply learn or reflect on the underlying concepts and mechanics of the web. The problem I see here is that there are things I dont even know about and I would I need a good overview about the things that they even exist, like a book for example. Of course, I could just google individual topics, but the problem is that I don’t always know *what* I should even be googling. That’s why a well-structured roadmap, book, or resource where the relevant information is collected and explained in a coherent way would be extremely helpful.

Because of that, I want to be very clear: I’m **not** looking for tutorials on JavaScript, CSS, HTML syntax, or how to use frameworks like React, Vue, etc. I already work with those technologies on a daily basis.

What I’m interested in are topics like:

* Authentication & authorization (sessions, tokens, OAuth, etc.)
* Cookies, storage, and state management
* Caching strategies (browser, CDN, server-side)
* HTTP fundamentals and request/response lifecycle
* Security concepts (CORS, CSP, CSRF, XSS, same-origin policy)
* How browsers and servers actually interact
* General web architecture and system design concepts

I want to better understand *why* things work the way they do, not just *how* to implement them in a specific stack.

If you know any resources that explain these concepts well (beginner-friendly but not superficial is ideal), I’d really appreciate your recommendations.

Feel the satisfaction of simply pressing ""execute"" and watching your drone do all the hard work.

Unlike most programming games the game isn't divided into distinct levels that you have to complete but features a continuous progression.

Farming earns you resources which can be spent to unlock new technology.

Programming is done in a simple language similar to Python. The beginning of the game is designed to teach you all the basic programming concepts you will need by introducing them one at a time.

While it introduces everything that is relevant, it won't hold your hand when it comes to solving the various tasks in the game. You will have to figure those out for yourself, and that can be very challenging if you have never programmed before.

If you are an experienced programmer, you should be able to get through the early game very quickly and move on to the more complex tasks of the later game, which should still provide interesting challenges.

Although the programming language isn't exactly Python, it's similar enough that Python IntelliSense works well with it. All code is stored in .py files and can optionally be edited using external code editors like VS Code. When the ""File Watcher"" setting is enabled, the game automatically detects external changes.

Hope you like the coding game concept! :)

The most important components are a great keyboard, a very fast editor (I prefer vim), a comfortable chair, limited distractions, ... it's much more about the physical act of typing, and muscle memory, and being in the zone than I think a lot of non-programmers think.

Most of what you're doing is flow, being in the zone, and doing things you've done many times before, much more so than cracking some new algorithm you've never worked with before, or doing in-depth research.

Most of the time when you're programming, you aren't having deep thoughts, you're just focused, and your fingers are gliding across the keys.  Things like what terminal you have, how you structure tabs in your browser, etc, things that are closest to your inner most process, are what is most important.

It's sort of like if you watch someone doing any physical act producing something, like someone making pottery, or creating stained glass windows, like all of the things you're using right at the point of actual creation are the most important things.

And like something like making pottery, or learning to play tennis, you can't really Youtube your way to it, or read it in a book, in my opinion the only way to learn to do the thing is to do the thing.  Because when you're doing the thing, you aren't really thinking about it as much as you are just kind of zoning and getting into the flow of making it.  It's very much about learning a skill through physical practice.

The market for teaching people how to program is very lucrative (gold rush and selling shovels, all over again), so don't listen to just to whoever claims to be an authority.

On instagram, I saw this video of a person (I won't mention who it is, but many of you probably already know him) talking about how if you want to impress people in a C++ tech interview, instead of doing ""for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {}"" the boring ""amateur"" way, you have to do ""for (auto i{0uz};)"" in order to look cool and experienced.

Well, first off, you're not really impressing many people (except maybe for beginners) by applying these tricks. People who don't program won't know the difference, and experienced programmers genuinely won't give a shit (and might in fact think your code is inferior, since it's less readable now).

But most importantly, memorizing lots of tricks won't make you a good programmer. You know what makes you a good programmer? Understanding fundamentals and learning creative problem solving, that's what you really need.

Please, for the love of God, stop following pop-coding ""coaches"". Their advice is often useless, and can waste your time by making you focus on the wrong things. As far as they're concerned, they WANT you to waste your time on them because it gives them more watchtime. Spend your time by instead working on projects you're interested in and reading up on the fundamentals of coding.

* **Gallery view** with all photos for an area (potentially hundreds per city), with basic search/filtering
* **Map view** with pins for each spot, ideally showing photo thumbnails (Apple Maps style)
* Ability to **share** a full city map (e.g. London) or a single spot with other users

This is just an MVP for **10–20 users**, and I don’t have a strong coding background, so I’m looking for something beginner-friendly that’s still reasonable to scale later.

Questions:

* Would you go **React Native, Flutter, or web-first** for this?
* What backend makes the most sense (Firebase, Supabase, etc.)?
* Any big gotchas with photo uploads, map performance, or reading location data?

If you’ve built anything similar (photos + maps), I’d love to hear what you’d recommend."

I’m currently working on a capstone project with very little knowledge on robotics and programming. Our study is a voice-controlled robotic glove as hand writing assistance using Raspberry Pi for stroke patients. Our proposed materials were Raspberry Pi (pico), Digital MEMS microphone, servo motors

QUESTIONS:

1. Initially, we wanted to use Raspberry Pi Pico 2 since it’s compact. However, we’re not quite sure if it is capable of working with voice automation and other components of the study. Is it possible with raspberry pi pico 2 or not? If not, please also drop your suggestions on whether should we use microprocessor or microcontroller. (If possible, recommend affordable materials)

2. What type of textile should we use for the robotic glove (does not cover the finger tips and only extend up to the palm region) if we would like to embed the microprocessor/microcontroller in it along with the motors?

Due to financial constraints, I have a strict timeline to secure a job within the next 5–6 months.

**Current Skill Set & Experience:**

* **ML/Data:** Familiar with core ML algorithms and Data Analysis (pre-processing/EDA). I am comfortable with the concepts but not yet an expert.
* **Backend:** Core Python proficiency. I built a Flask blog application (following Corey Schafer’s curriculum) to understand the basics.
* **DSA:** Willing to dedicate \~2 hours daily if necessary.

I’ve observed that landing a pure Data Science/ML Engineer/AI Engineer role as a fresher is increasingly difficult in the current market without a specialized Master's degree or significant experience. Consequently, I shifted my focus to Backend Engineering to increase my employability.

However, after completing the Flask project, I realized the massive scope of what remains (Django/FastAPI, REST API optimization, Database management, DevOps concepts) and felt a bit overwhelmed given my timeline.

I am considering pausing deep ML work to go ""all-in"" on Backend (Django/FastAPI + System Design) to land a standard Software Engineering job first. My long-term goal remains working at the intersection of AI and Engineering (Backend Engineer (AI)).

1. **Backend vs. Parallel Learning:** Given the 6-month crunch, should I focus exclusively on mastering the Backend architecture (APIs, DBs, DevOps), or is it feasible to keep pushing ML/DL side-by-side?
2. **The ""Backend First"" Path:** Is the strategy of securing a Backend role first and *then* pivoting to AI/ML internally (or via side projects) a realistic path for a fresher in 2024/2025?
3. **GenAI/Automation Gigs:** I see opportunities in GenAI/Automation (scripting/agents) that seem easier to land right now than core SE roles. However, I am worried this is a short-term trap with low long-term career capital. Is this fear valid?
4. **DSA Allocation:** If I commit to the Backend path, is 2 hours of DSA a day sufficient to clear the screening rounds for these types of roles?

Any advice on refining this roadmap would be appreciated."

product or it can create confusion if the feedback contradicts the original plan. It is a
common challenge for people building new tools or platforms. Without a clear system, the
project can shift too quickly or lose its purpose.

There are different ways creators manage this. Some filter feedback through a strict set of
principles. Others focus on patterns rather than individual comments. Ember on ember.do
takes a community centered approach where feedback influences the direction, but
decisions still follow a clear vision. It seems to reduce noise while keeping early voices
involved.

What I find interesting is how different people decide which feedback deserves attention.
Some prioritize technical feasibility. Others prioritize user experience. Some focus on long
term impact. It can be difficult to stay objective when enthusiasm for the project is high and
ideas arrive from many directions.

For anyone who has built something and worked with early feedback, how did you decide
what to keep? Did you use a framework? Did you rely on intuition? Or did you involve others
in the evaluation?

Understanding how others navigate this might help many builders who are dealing with the
same challenge right now."

When I was satisfied with the result, i compiled the game with the software's internal compiler, and LO!  The result ""coolgame.exe"" runs on every windows machine i tried it on.

Now, I've decided to go hard and really get into the hard parts of C++ that I've been avoiding because its hard.  So, I've been writing simple but effective programs in Visual Studio 2026 using the C++ setup (programs that do network math and labor mostly [just to get a good feel for the language]).

Now, as far as I can tell (I could be wrong), I am compiling my programs as one should.  And they work great ""on my machine"".

However, when I try them on any other Windows machine, it errors, demands a few .dll files, and stops.

Now, I make a cute workaround by making a batch file that gains admin rights and copies the dlls from the folder its in to where the dlls are supposed to be (sysWOW64, system32).  This is not a real solution, this is an ""because i said so"" workaround.

So, heres the meat of my question: as you can see, an entire video game runs without fail on a variety of machines, but my glorified command line calculators demand a lot before running.

Clearly, I need a stronger grip on the nature of this corner of the dev world.  However, I dont even know how to frame this gap in my knowledge such that I can research it myself and ""git gud"".

Was hoping to get some feedback on this if possible but my reasonings are below as to why I think this is a bad inheritance design. Not sure if it’s the correct reasoning but would great to help some help.

1. The earnInterest() method only relates to two of the subclasses, so it has to be implemented in CurrentAccount even though that concept does not exist there. We could move this method to the individual subclasses instead of the superclass.

2. The withdraw() method is becoming confusing. One account can only withdraw if it has not reached its withdrawal limit, while another can only withdraw if it is not within the maturity lock. This is arguably fine because the method is abstract, so it is expected that the logic will differ between subclasses.

3. There is a large amount of duplication in the withdraw() method. Inheritance is supposed to help avoid this, but because each account needs slightly different rules, the duplication becomes unavoidable.

4. If we were to add another product where we couldn’t deposit or withdraw or potentially both then this would be another case where inheritance is bad as we would have to throw an exception or then build another abstract class which has withdraw and deposit and then those account classes that have those methods would have to extend off that"

I'm interested in making an rpg where the gameplay aesthetic is basically you, the player, reading manga/comic book panels vertically, like you'd do with a very basic manga reader.

The way you interact with the content is you just tap on a visual part of any given panel, that's somehow marked as interactive, and then a preview panel appears at the bottom of the screen, scrolling the page and content downward, then you can confirm your action or pick something else.

It will have light item and ability customization, so I should be able to replace drawn objects at runtime dynamically, preferably in a seamless way that keeps the visuals looking just like ordinary manga.

I wouldn't mind having basic effects/animations like various parts of a panel 'popping' out for a bit and stuff like that, but generally speaking I don't need animation.

Other requirements would be the usage of a strongly typed language that includes interfaces and other means of abstraction, some kind of integration with a branching story editor like articity draft or something in-engine, the ability to do automated testing, some kind of easy graphical object editing and an active community that makes youtube tutorials, because I am not the studious type...

It does not have to be a typical engine, stuff like a typescript framework is good too if there are game libraries that make development streamlined for this type of game, though I prefer something that doesn't drown the user in dependency hell...

I mostly know c#, typescript and python, but learning a new programming language isn't a problem

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pq70gb/scrimba_vs_freecodecamp_vs_the_odin_project_vs,Scrimba vs freecodecamp vs the odin project vs,"Hey everyone,

I need some help in choosing the right learning platform for web dev. I've been using freeCodeCamp since 2023 and I loved its structure: learn a concept -> guided project -> unguided project. That format works great for me and I learned a lot of stuff that I still remember.

The big problem is: FCC removed its video content. Staying focused on long lectures is a huge problem for me, because of that I can't learn on freeCodeCamp anymore.

So now I’m looking at alternatives:

* Scrimba: seems interactive and video-based, which I need, but from what I've understood there are no projects where you actually get to write *everything* on your own and it's really shallow in terms of libraries and general depth
* The Odin Project: To me personally it seems impossible to learn here, because there's lots and lots of text which is just a big no-no for my small clip thinking brain (thank you, tiktok).
* freeCodeCamp: still amazing structure, but now mostly text-only which also makes it hard. The bite sized video lectures were perfect, but they're not there anymore.

I’m not a total beginner. I know vanilla JS pretty well (up until DOM stuff from FCC), but once frameworks, Node libs, databases, backend tools, etc. enter the game, I stops working. So I'm searching for a deeper dive into the full ecosystem:

* JavaScript & TypeScript
* Node.js + Basic libraries like os, fs, http
* React + Tailwind
* Git, Linux, Docker
* SQL
* possibly Kubernetes and CI/CD

Ideally, the platform should:

* go really deep, not just scratching on the surface-level
* include project-based practice (guided and unguided are nice)
* offer both frontend and backend (can be in two different places) or full-stack
* videos would help a **lot** (<- underline that twice)
* certificates are a huge plus but not required, if it's a good course then certs aren't important at all

Budget isn’t the deciding factor. I just want the most effective structure for actually retaining and practicing the material.

For people who’ve used these platforms or any other platforms: which one fits this learning style best?

Thanks in advance!"

I'm curious to see what others think about this topic as it's a fruitless debate currently.

so I was hobby programming in python for a couple years already, very lasily and with month long breaks, didn't even finish anything, mostly because I got disappointed in the ideas of my projects, but got some coding experience and understanding how it generally works, and now I'm entering my gap year era when I will have all the free time to pursue what I want.

I was planning to learn c++ for some time but couldn't get to it, and recently I thought about what I actually wanted to do in my life and I decided to try myself in gamedev and learn c++ on the way, given that I spent basically my entire life playing games, and that I already had an idea for one that seems very exciting to create.

but after some research into how to actually do this in real life and not my fantasies I encountered a problem: I want to build my game from scratch to both learn c++ and game development better and more thorough than just using other people's engines (and I know that it's very time consuming and will take a bunch of time, but as I said I'll have all the time in the world for at least a couple of years), but the game I want to create is 3d, and making a 3d game from scratch as I heard is INCREDIBLY time consuming (even too much for the amount of free time I have), and I'm afraid that while I'm writing it I'll just go into my usual burnout and nothing will be done.

But then I got an idea for another game, which also seems interesting to me, and it's much simpler for multiple reasons, one of them being that it's 2d, and it should be much much easier to write from scratch, but I feel like I still like the original idea a bit more.

So finally the question itself: should I write my original idea using an already existing engine, or is writing a 2d game from scratch better as a learning experience?

We are currently have modules regarding databases, advanced programming and api development with a client app. The problem is that the database lectures was so theoritical but for the assignments we had to create 2 DB systems with PostgreSQL and MongoDB, without learning any of these languages during lectures. I hardly managed to do the assignments since it was the first time I had to write postgre and mongo and they assessments required to apply advanced knowledge to code the systems. On the API module it was the same. The professor focused on teaching material regarding how to complete the weekly assignments but the final one was doable since the most of the part covered from the weekly tasks. On advanced programming we had to use c# that we used in the previous years but we had to create a cross platform app with blazor and we never saw examples during lectures on how to set up a blazor app and I felt overwhelmed from the amount of reseach I had to do myself. The following semester we have an IoT's module and the prof told us we will create an IoT device in a simulator with python for the final assessment. We never touched python before. The other module is about game development and they changed the curriculum to use unreal engine with c++ instead of unity, we never wrote c++ before. The last module is about penetration testing and the module guide says that we will have to write bash scripts and python to simulate some attacks on our Uni's servers.

i take the raw transcript and paste it into an llm with the following prompt: ""convert this spoken logic into python pseudocode steps.""

""the implement"": I just paste that comment block right into the IDE.

This method makes calls to orher methods that change the object's state. A simplified example:

`SomeClass::unit_under_test()
{
    this->f();  // changes the state of this
    // ...
}`

I've used C++ syntax since that's the language I'm using, but the question itself is not specific to C++. For those unfamiliar, `this` refers to the current object of the class that you are in scope of.

My question is: how do you properly test `unit_under_test`?

I am not really that interested in testing `f()`, because there is a separate unit test for that. I also can't mock it without making changes to source code, because there is no way to link in a mock for `f()` that will end up getting called here instead of the actual member function.

You could also imagine that `f()` could be fairly complex. It could itself call a bunch of other functions that do various things and which should themselves be unit tested. Digging into the implementation of those functions starts to feel like it's getting outside the scope of the test of just this function.

So, it seems hard to know how best to test this kind of thing, and I wanted to know what others' thoughts are."
https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pq1jtc/software_engineering_at_30_bootcamp_vs_community,Software engineering at 30 bootcamp vs community,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for honest advice and different perspectives on a possible career change (or career expansion).

I have a degree in International Business, but after graduating I worked in roles unrelated to my degree, so I don’t have professional experience directly connected to it. At the same time, I’ve become genuinely interested in learning programming / software engineering — not only as a potential career switch, but also as a new skill I could combine with my business background in the future and as a strong plus on my resume.

Here’s my situation and my doubts:

• I can’t realistically commit to a full-time traditional university (time + cost).
• A bootcamp appeals to me because of the structure, guidance, accountability, and also the opportunity to meet people and network.
• English is not my first language, and although I use it daily, I want to keep improving. Being in an environment where I’m pushed to communicate more in English feels like a plus.

So far, I’ve started learning on my own:
	•	freeCodeCamp
	•	Planning to try The Odin Project next

I’m realistic about expectations:
	•	I know a bootcamp won’t guarantee a job
	•	I know the market is competitive
	•	I understand I may not get hired right away

My goal is to build real skills, start with solid foundations, and keep studying long-term. Even if I initially apply for jobs related to my original career

One important factor is that I currently have the option to stop working for about 6 months, since my husband can support me during that time. That’s why I’m seriously considering an intensive learning path like a bootcamp, so I can fully focus during that period.

I looked into Hack Reactor, but my experience has been concerning:
	•	I was told about a full scholarship. I applied and 3 weeks later they informed it wasn’t available for now.
	•	I pass the CCAT test, contacted them to know about the next steps. Someone told me they will contact me but is been almost a month a haven’t heard for them.

Because of that, I’m unsure whether Hack Reactor — or bootcamps in general — are still an option right now.

So my main questions are:
	1.	Bootcamp vs community college vs online university — what would you recommend in 2026 for someone in my position?
	2.	Is a bootcamp still worth it mainly for structure, foundations, and momentum?
	3.	Are online universities that people often recommend on Reddit actually a good option?
	4.	If you were in my situation — limited time/money, strong motivation, and a non-tech degree — what path would you choose?

Thanks in advance for any advice or personal experiences. I really appreciate it."

I'm a first-year IT student currently dual-booting Windows 11 and Ubuntu. I’m at a crossroads and would love some veteran insight. My main interests are AI development, Software Engineering, and IoT.

I’m trying to decide if I should stick with dual-booting or transition to one primary setup (likely Windows + WSL2). Here is my dilemma:

1. The Programming Side:

AI: I’ve heard WSL2 supports GPU passthrough for CUDA, but is the performance overhead significant compared to native Linux?

IoT: I’m worried about hardware interfacing. Does WSL2 handle USB/Serial devices (like ESP32/Arduino) reliably, or is it a ""driver nightmare"" compared to native Linux?

Dev Workflow: Linux feels faster for CLI tools, but WSL2 seems to have improved its filesystem speed significantly.

2. Beyond Programming (The ""Life"" Factor):

Windows Utilities: I rely on the full Microsoft Office suite for school reports and occasionally Adobe apps. On Windows, everything is ""plug-and-play"" for peripherals.

Linux Perks: I love the customization (dotfiles, tiling window managers) and the privacy/minimalism. It’s snappy and doesn’t have the ""Windows bloat.""

The Cons: On Linux, I struggle with the lack of native support for certain non-dev software (Office web versions aren't the same, and Wine/bottles can be hit-or-miss for specific apps). On Windows, even with WSL2, I feel the system is ""heavy"" and privacy is a concern.

My Question: For those in AI/IoT, do you find WSL2 ""good enough"" to replace a native Linux partition, or do the hardware/performance trade-offs make dual-booting (or pure Linux) still superior in 2025?

How do you manage your non-programming life if you're 100% on Linux?

My goal is to try to program an iOS app and deploy it in the app store as a hobby - not to find a job. I feel that this time around it might be a bit easier as I can use newer tools to supplement my learning and ask my silly hyperspecific questions, but at the same time I want to make sure that I'm able to understand the fundamentals of programming.

I've returned to freeCodeCamp as I remember taking their courses when I was younger, but I'm second guessing whether this is the right way to go about it. I've been progressing relatively quickly through the initial courses, but a part of me is wondering whether this is the most efficient path.

I know there are a few threads on similar questions, but I was hoping to get the latest views on the most effective ""path"" to learning iOS development with VERY rudimentary programming experience.

I’m a full-stack developer and I can build applications end to end on my own, so technically I’m not stuck. The problem is more in my head.

I’ll spend some time working with Node.js, then I suddenly start thinking that maybe I should switch to C# because it feels more “serious” or widely used in enterprise. After that, Go starts looking attractive because it’s fast, clean, and great for backend work. Then something else shows up… and I switch again.

I’ve been doing this for a while now, and it feels like I’m trapped in a loop. I keep restarting instead of actually finishing things. I end up knowing multiple languages, but mostly at a shallow level, and I rarely ship anything I’m truly proud of.

If you’ve been through something similar, how did you break out of it? How do you decide when learning a new language is actually worth it versus just another distraction? Any mindset shifts or rules that helped you stay focused?

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pphjmj/harfbuzz_freetype_on_baremetal_gsub_shaping,Harfbuzz freetype on baremetal gsub shaping,"HarfBuzz experts,

I’m trying to use HarfBuzz 8.3.0 with FreeType 2.13.2 and LVGL 9.2 on a bare-metal embedded target and I’m running into hard faults during Indic (GSUB) shaping. I want to check whether this is a known limitation or something wrong in my build/integration.

Target:NXP [i.MX](http://i.MX) RT1064 (1 MB internal SRAM + 4 MB Flash) on bare-metal

Toolchain: arm-none-eabi-gcc with newlib-nano

Display: 16x128 LED matrix

UI: LVGL with a custom HarfBuzz text shaping hook

Stack: size - 64kB ; stack region: SRAM\_DTC

Heap: size - 128kB ; heap region: SRAM\_OC2

Libraries:

FreeType 2.13.2 (static) + HarfBuzz 8.3.0 (static, Meson build)

Font: NotoSansDevanagari, AnjaliOldLipi and so on as a C array

All threads, atomics, glib, ICU, getenv, etc. are disabled. No pthreads, no OS services.

I have two build setups with very different behavior.

Case 1 (non-cyclic build):

I build FreeType without HarfBuzz, then build HarfBuzz with FreeType, and do NOT rebuild FreeType again with HarfBuzz enabled.

Result: English text works and Indic gives me hard fault at GSUB.

Case 2 (cyclic build, as described in FreeType docs):

Build FreeType without HarfBuzz.

Build HarfBuzz with FreeType enabled.

Rebuild FreeType with HarfBuzz enabled.

Result: English and Indic text breaks, hard fault or hb\_font\_destroy gives error.

The fault consistently appears somewhere in the GSUB path. The backtrace usually goes through hb\_shape(), hb\_shape\_full(), hb\_shape\_plan\_execute(), hb\_ot\_shape(), and apply\_forward() in GSUB. In some runs the crash appears closer to hb\_font\_destroy(), in others during hb\_shape(), so I suspect memory corruption or an assumption violation rather than a single bad call.

Important observation:

When FreeType is NOT rebuilt with HarfBuzz, English works but Indic fails.

When FreeType IS rebuilt with HarfBuzz, both English and Indic fail and I get a hard fault.

Occasionally, I also get an access violation and I found this:

[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22388899/harfbuzz-hb-shape-leads-to-access-violation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22388899/harfbuzz-hb-shape-leads-to-access-violation)

My understanding (please correct me if wrong):

HarfBuzz does all shaping (GSUB/GPOS, Indic, Arabic, etc.) and FreeType loads glyphs and rasterizes them. The FreeType ↔ HarfBuzz cyclic dependency mainly exists for auto-hinting improvements, not for shaping correctness.

Since my display is a very low-resolution 16x128 LED matrix, hinting quality is not very important, but correct glyph order is.

So my questions are:

1. Is HarfBuzz GSUB shaping expected to work on bare-metal targets with no OS and newlib-nano?
2. Is rebuilding FreeType with HarfBuzz actually required if shaping is already done by HarfBuzz?
3. Are there GSUB code paths that assume stack size, libc behavior, or memory features that may not exist on embedded targets?
4. How much stack and heap would be required for proper Indic rendering?

The project itself is simple:

* Android app for entering daily data
* Web page for viewing the data and exporting a PDF
* Firebase used as backend

Revisiting it helped me understand **how much I’ve improved** and what I’d do differently now.

For beginners here:

* It’s okay if your early projects are messy
* Finishing something teaches more than perfect code
* Revisiting old work is a great way to learn

Is there a good reason why you would write your method like this? I feel like this makes your methods harder to read once they get more complicated than this example.
I have the same problem with ternary if/else is JS. I understand you have to type less charaters but its really easy to make your code less readable IMO.

With respect to the askers, those questions are wrong-headed. Code isn't the hard part. On this topic, here is my

<rant>

I reply that we programmers use languages as tools. We use those tools to create programs. We test those programs. We package those programs. We sell those packages, or publish them as open source, or deliver them to an employer, or whatever. We get bug reports from users. We fix (some of) those bugs. We repackage and republish.

Code is only part of the trade of programming.

Professional programmers understand what our users need. We have clear vision for what a finished software package is and does and looks like. We get our work tested, packaged, and across the finish line.

Along the way we write some code.  The thing is, if we can do the other things well, the code is (usually) pretty easy, comparatively.

At the same time, pure code isn't finished and doesn't have any users. That gets very boring very fast.

Wanna see some examples of software packages of a scale that one person -- you -- can make and publish and try to attract live people as users?

* These are Javascript utility packages. https://www.npmleaderboard.org/
* These are plugins for WordPress:  https://wordpress.org/plugins/
* ...for Python.  https://pypi.org/search/?q=&o=&c=Topic+%3A%3A+Artistic+Software
* Indie games. https://itch.io/

There are other lists and repositories of packages out there for the searching.

Laying down lines of code is just a part of our trade. The programmers of many of those packages did the whole job: explanation, instructions, code, testing, packaging, publishing, and then bug fixing.  Read through some of the package descriptions; they'll give you a feel for what a piece of finished software looks like.

Don't be too intimidated by the packages that turn up on the first page of these lists. The best of them have been around for many years, and have been through a lot of changes to perfect them.

But those packages started somewhere. Yours can too.

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pp8qga/what_do_you_do_when_not_all_properties_of_an,What do you do when not all properties of an,"Hi!

Today I continued to make my little Latin project by trying to formulate a Verb class after successfully implementing the Nouns.

I already knew that implementing verbs is gonna be a hell of a lot more complicated than the Nouns because they have a lot more properties to them, and some of them are not compatible among eachother.

For context: In latin, words change based on certain Grammatical features, most of the time their suffix. The most important among them are the Case (Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative, Ablative, Vocative), the Numerus (Singular, Plural) and the Gender (Masculinum, Neutrum and Feminium).

Because the last one is more intrinsically linked to the declination type, for now, i created several Declination classes (A, Us, Um and Third) that inherit the Noun class. If you now want a specific version of the Noun based on Numerus and Case, you simply use the method getString(Casus casus, Numerus nummerus) of the Noun and get the fitting suffix from a map<CasusNumerus, String> attached to the stem of the Noun. (CasusNumerus is a record that simply contains a casus and a numerus)

This is not going to be as simple with the verbs.

For the start: Verbs can have the following properties:
Voice(active, passive)
Person(First, second, third)
Numerus(Singular, Plural)
Modus(Indicative, Subjunctive, Imperative)
Tempus(Presence, Perfect, Imperfect, Plusquamperfect, Future)

There are finite and non-finite forms of verbs. the non-finite verbs do not use person or numerus at all, most notably the Infinitive, which is the only one i wanna implement for now.
Of the finite forms, the subjuncitve is not of interest right now for me, but it also isnt particulary different from the Indicative in terms of the property table. however, the Imperative, due to its function to give commands, does not use the First person and also not certain combinations with the third and second one for some reason.

As you can see, this gets very complicated. Further complicated is this by the perfect conjugations: They have actually in some cases different stems from the presence form, which requires me to make additional classes for the perfect forms despite them making no sense to exist separately from their presence forms because the declinations for the nouns in my current setup are also just extentions of the nouns.

[https://github.com/Hellinfernel/Latin-Learing-Program](https://github.com/Hellinfernel/Latin-Learing-Program)

I havnt pushed any of my changes for the verbs yet, but i just wanna show you my general setup. Implementing verbs feels currently just very, very overwhelming and i dont know where to start in all honesty and how i should handle cases in which some combinations of the enums just dont make sense."

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1poz5lp/web_configurable_leaderboard_from_api,Web configurable leaderboard from api,"I have been programming and building websites on some level for 30 years but I'd still call myself a beginner really.

I have been trying to get back into web dev and have an idea for a project, but I'm not sure of the best way to execute the idea.

There is an API I plan on using. I am going to have a list of user IDs I will feed into the API and get back the players ranks (and other info) which I will display on a webpage. The ranks really won't change much day to day. The leaderboard will be displayed on a TV which will just show a single webpage with the data on it.

My biggest question is does it make sense for me to store the data locally? If so how would be the best way to do this? I have considered showing players change in rank from last week/month, which in that case I'd have to store the old historic data somewhere. But even if I didn't do that would it make sense to store the data? Vs pulling it from from the API every time the page gets refreshed? Which on the TV it would only be once or twice a day. But if I put it on a webpage where other uses could access it it might be refreshed many times a day. I worry about sending too many calls to the API, which is perhaps not a big concern.

I have been learning javascript which I'd use for most of the heavy lifting. I know if I plan to save anything I'd have to use backend code like node.js or php or python. Again I have been learning JS so I'd learn towards node.js. Would storing this data in a database be overkill? Or should I just save JSON data locally?

Another feature I'd like to add is an admin screen that a couple people could access that could add/remove people from the scoreboard. The list of players won't change often so I could just manually update it in the code, but this project while practical is also a chance for me to learn. I've never done any backend webdev or database access. Heck I've never worked with an API before.

I just wanted to talk this out and see if I am on the right track. I guess the biggest question is if I am going to store data should I do it via local JSON files or a database? And if I should use a DB my gut would be to use mySQL since I've had some exposure to it, but it sounds like MondoDB might be a better choice since I am working with JSON data."

I’m currently a Management Information Systems (MIS) student. I have a solid grasp of Python syntax (loops, functions, data types, etc.). When I read someone else's code or follow a tutorial, I understand exactly what is happening. However, the moment I open a blank file to build something from scratch, I get stuck.

For example, I’m currently following Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Code. Today's project was a **Caesar Cipher**. I understand the concept (shifting letters by 'n'), but I struggled to translate that into logic:

* How should I store the alphabet?
* How do I handle the wrap-around (Z to A) using modulo?
* What exactly needs to be inside the `for` loop versus outside?

When I watch the solution, it feels incredibly simple and I say 'Of course!', but I can't seem to make those connections on my own. It feels like I have all the bricks and tools, but I don't know how to draw the architectural plan.

1. What is the best way to practice 'algorithmic thinking' rather than just learning syntax?
2. For those who were in this 'I can read but can't write' phase, what was the turning point for you?
3. Besides writing pseudocode, are there specific exercises or platforms you recommend for absolute beginners to train this 'connection-making' muscle?

So I’m wondering:

* Is multithreading considered “legacy” or risky now?
* Are async/event-driven models actually better for most scalable backends?
* Or is this more about developer experience than performance?

\- Would you change the order or add/remove steps?

\- Should I focus more on theory first, or just keep building small projects?

\- Any beginner mistakes I should avoid when getting into computer vision?

I’m not coming from a CS background, so any honest advice is welcome.

Thanks in advance 🙏"

i looked up timer things and have found a standard timer, and some sort of swing timer, which may be more related. however, I cannot figure out how to implement either in my program. can someone help me understand how it works? essentially, i think the timer should call snakemove every half second or so.

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pnzh5g/escaping_the_intermediates_plateau,Escaping the intermediates plateau,"Hello r/learnprogramming,

I hope this fits the rules, having read them I don't think I'm violating any, and I apologize if I have unintentionally.

I got done with CS50's Introduction to Python about a week ago, with the general focus of learning computational linguistics (what I plan on going for in my Master's). With that, I feel confident enough, at least in general, with the concepts of OOP, inheritance, functions, list/dict comprehension and regex. I feel like talking about the history of my work because it's important to my problem, and also to give context about how I feel and why.

My first project is an analyzer for Akkadian nouns (the ancient language of Babylon, if you're not familiar with it) that used regular expressions and to find an inputted noun's case, number and gender. It included a GUI with PySimpleGUI/FreeSimpleGUI, which was very thin. From this, I learned more properly about OOP and instances.

My second project was a terminal-based game called Snail, the object of which is to walk over all tiles without touching a tile you visited already. It's a simple enough idea, and from it I learned about using the game loop and screen updates.

My third was another computational linguistics project that generates well-formed but meaningless expressions in the style of Noam Chomsky's Syntactic Structures in accordance with a well-formed sentence structure inputted by the user, that uses regexes to reject illegal ones (for example, an adjective can't be followed by a verb in a single sentence that isn't complex, so an expression like ""abominable liquidates"" is considered illegal). From this, I learned about constraint-based design.

My fourth was a joke political test like the Political Compass, that starts off with regular propositions about social and economic issues before veering off into random, idiotic propositions like ""Raw meat is bad for you. Raw sewage is good for your spleen."". I wanted to make a GUI for it, but found the architecture far too daunting and so I left it be. I'd have to make an input buffer and an update function as well as two pointers for the lists of propositions and the propositions within (e.g. economic propositions point at 0, and since there's 8, the last one is \[0\]\[7\], for example) which made me refactor my code in its entirety.

The last one was what made me realize that instead of putting my focus on something specific, my projects are all over the place, and the fact that I spent little time honing a specific skill, like GUI interfaces in specific, made my skillset broad, but not deep enough for any bigger projects. I mean, I have two projects about linguistics, and two wildcard projects, so I'm all over the place and can't land on something specific.

I'd like to ask: has anyone else experienced this, and if so, what have you done? I'm considering focusing my skills on one specific thing for now, but I wonder if the skills I'd learn in, say, webdev with Flask or Django would carry over to Tkinter, or what I'd make with Tkinter could carry over at least somewhat to working with Matplotlib. Those are just examples, but I wonder if focusing on one specific thing for now will carry over knowledge to when I focus on other things.

Of course, just learning a library or technique's insufficient, but I'd like to focus on one library or something as the venue for my projects temporarily. I'd imagine that learning how to modularize input, GUI and logic in one specific library would carry over, but I'm not sure. My question is less ""How do I learn to use library X?"" and more ""How can I learn to integrate a library with my logic by focusing on library X?"" It's more about architecture and planning than it is about any specific library.

One machine prints 1 -1 -32768 -8388608 8388608, while another prints -1 32767 -1 -32768 -8388608. I think if I understand why aux's value differ on both machines, I can explain the rest of the misalignemnts. But why aux's value differ on the machines? The first does wrapping (which is the expected behaviour), but what the second one does? Until November 2025 the second machine had the wrapping bevahiour of the first. Then I updated to December 2025 on both, and the second machine broke the computations.

So the question remains. Why the aux's value is different on the machine? And a secondary question, what the second machine does that transformed 32768 to -1?

I asked an AI, but told me that to get the wrapping behaviour I must run the code to Release mode. Nedless to say the print was identical, both on Debug and Release mode."

A client asked me to develop a simple API for an ecommerce, we're talking about a rather big DB, albeit populated with rather static geographical data.  He has no issues with me re-using the code and content for other projects, so I was thinking about offering the same data as a public, paid REST API. As I said, it's basically static data returned as JSON, but being a niche offering it could be useful to others.

I have to admit, I'm a bit lost on what is the ideal path to follow for building something like this. My lack of backend dev knowledge is biting back hard.

If I had to build it just for my client, I'd probably just be using Wordpress REST APIs, but given that exposing it to a larger audience would require managing auth, payments, I'd rather spend some time with a more professional solution.

I've found out there are a millions way to do this, from AWS, Supabase, to something like Kong, to hosted solutions like open-saas. They all look amazing but they're clearly targeted to way more knowledgeable developers than me and for way more complicated services than the one at hand.

Is there a managed solution that lets me handle mainly the content and methods, leaving auth, permissions and user management to better developers than me?

Android Application Development

""Will this be of use in the future?""

Whenever i do something it usually goes something like this:
*write basic stuff*
Hm... how do i do this?
*Google it*
O! So that piece of code does exactly what i need
*copy paste into a code*
*It doesn't work*
*Spent whole day making it work*
Yay it's working

I always feel like a fraud not being able to write myself despite learning it for almost 2 years and
I never been able to get a job in the field which makes it feeling even worse

I'm a non-CS grad, I did law, and I'm not from the U.S.

I am a future FDM software engineering joiner (course starts on 19 Jan 2026), and I am also a former coding bootcamp student. For those that do not know FDM, they do a 3-month training programme that gives you fullstack coverage, then you will go for interviews to get a placement with a client (think the usual DSA questions). In my country, the clients are banks, and the tech stack taught is Java/Spring/React. I was advised to try and start studying the course objectives as much as I can so I struggle less during the course.

***Please no comments about how I shouldn't join FDM. I know where I stand in the job market, having spent about 5 months on job applications, and I'm very grateful and thrilled to receive an offer from FDM. Please just be happy for me, and help me with my journey!***

I completed CS50's Python and Intro to Programming so I can code in C, Python, JavaScript (poor front end skills though), and also have started programming in Java. I have projects on my portfolio, and I am really passionate about software engineering and I've bought some books to start. The more I read online about what CS majors read, the more overwhelmed I get. Additionally, I feel the added pressure of impressing the interviewers at an interview to get the top banks (think investment banks), but that's in 3-4 months' time.

These are the books I have bought so far, and have started reading:

* SICP (JS Ed.) by Abelson and Sussman
* The Pragmatic Programmer (20th Ann. Ed.) by Thomas and Hunt
* Clean Code (4th Ed.)

Then there are other books that non-CS grads have been advised to get:

* Operating System Concepts (Dinosaur Book)
* Compilers Principles, Techniques, and Tools (Dragon Book)
* Introduction to the Theory of Computation by Sipser

And then there are books on Java and OOP:

* Effective Java by Bloch
* Core Java I and II by Horstmann
* Head First Design Patterns by Freeman and Robson

There are just so many books. I am VERY happy to read them because I think these are just fascinating and I enjoy reading the books I have so far... but in what order?

I'm a little confused about priorities because I've heard that DSA is taught very early on at university, but doesn't actually help you much on the job. Yet, I need to have a good understanding of it for interviews. I read *Grokking Algorithms* and *Grokking Data Structures*, and those were really fun reads, but those are just general overviews and theories; they don't actually help you with coding. Then I tried Leetcode and Neetcode, and however much I do, I just struggle with understanding because the video explanations aren't that great. So.... do I actually need to read Algorithms by Sedgewick and Wayne? How would that affect my job? But a lot of comments online have told me that this does require some understanding of Mathematics. Other reddit posts have pointed me towards MIT's Mathematics for Programming Course (but that looks pretty long) before reading this.

**tldr:**

* Which order should I buy / read the books above?
* Which books should I buy to get better at Java / in general?
* Do I actually need to read Algorithms by Sedgewick and Wayne? Will this affect my job? Prioritise before going for coding interviews?
* Alternatives to Leetcode / Neetcode because I barely understand the explanations?"

It's not known for anything but being one of the first for doing online classes. I'm in a CS adjacent program, but it's emphasis is heavy on programming. So CS for people that are bad at math.

This program, and maybe entire curriculum, is a joke. So far my Python and Javascript classes have been pretty alright but the HTML/CSS and SQL/Bash classes have been literally just freeCodeCamp and that's it. Nothing else. No feedback, course material, and bare minimum communication. The professor for both of those classes teaches 12 (!!!) classes in this department.

I've only done a summer session and the fall semester so far, so I'm still early enough to jump ship to a different institution, but I'm wondering if it's going to matter in the long run or not. The only advantage that this college has over others is that it's comparatively cheap.

Do I just tough it out and get the degree while teaching myself other languages, toolchains, and build my portfolio or do I run and find an different accredited 4 year that put more effort into their CS/adjacent programs?"

I’m in the UK and looking to switch into IT in my 30s. My goal is a backend developer role on a permanent contract, not freelancing or data science.

I’ve narrowed it down to C#/.NET or Python, and I’m getting mixed opinions:
	•	Python is often recommended because it’s “easier”
	•	C#/.NET seems more common in enterprise and long-term roles

For those actually working in the industry (especially in the UK):
	•	Which one has better job availability right now?
	•	Which is easier to break into as a junior?
	•	Any regrets choosing one over the other?

I’m focusing on practical backend development (APIs, databases, etc.), not AI or frontend.

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pmo24t/teaching_an_old_programmer_new_tricks,Teaching an old programmer new tricks,"I confess that I have a standard / frequent question around ""how do I create X type of app"", but there are three twists to the question, I promise! The FAQ helped, but before I go off and running, I want to ""test"" my hypothesis.

**First, I'm old**. Not too old to learn (approaching 60), just that I have old programming experience. So I typed programs from computer magazines in BASIC into Commodore VIC-20s and PETs back in the 80s and saved them on cassettes; I learned BASIC and STRUCTURED BASIC in high school in the 80s; I took BASIC/FORTRAN/COBOL courses in university in the 90s. I learned enough to write a menu system in BASIC for running in DOS back in the '80s that allowed me to add/subtract items, write batch files that would launch when the menu closed and then reopen the menu when I was done running whatever program was, compile it and run it in DOS. Used it for years. So I have \*\*\*SOME\*\*\* experience. Just nothing recent. Oh, and I also can debug basic HTML / CSS issues on websites but avoid javascript stuff at least for now. I'd rather run WordPress with free plugins than program my own. I'm more of a user than a developer.

The second twist is that I have **two very specific needs** in mind, both of which could perhaps be done with a robust GUI and back-end database instead of programming it. But well, I want something a bit more customizable to my specific issues to solve. So, like the videos recommend, I have specific problems to solve that will keep me interested! The first is harder and I have more passion for it; the second is easier and maybe where I should start, even though I'm not as excited about it.

And the third twist is that I am **NOT trying to build a revenue stream**. I'm open to having a small revenue stream tied to it enough to buy myself a coffee if someone wants the extra ""bits"", but just looking to use the apps myself, $$ is not my goal. If others in my immediate community find it useful, I'd be open to sharing the apps everywhere for free and with no advertising. Maybe some ""extras"" available in a pro version for $1 or something.

The first need would be a mobile app (iOS and Android) that acts like a **field recorder** as if someone was doing a survey or recording a business transaction BUT without local wifi/internet access. So, like you were out in the woods, say, doing biology research and you wanted to record which birds you saw, and the date/time/interesting details. BUT you also want to be able to record the equipment you were using and the place/location with sort of default ""profiles"". Like, ""Profile 1"" says you're using equipment X, Y, Z; Profile 2 says you're using X, A, B; Profile 3 says Y, Z, B, etc. But I want to load the default profiles in as starter info.

There are existing database apps that do this, but I have some unique usage links that I'll need to pull from unique style databases too, which the database apps didn't have the power to do. Ultimately, I need the initial recording apps (mostly dumping info into a set of fields in a database) and then once I'm back in civilization, uploading them to a more powerful PC app that would be almost the same software in PC form, with some extra printing, formatting, layout features. I confess I have no idea where that info is saved on the phone, or the PC, or the inbetween bits (common upload to cloud when there's a connection? Like synching photos?). Just that I want the data to eventually be in the PC for more processing. It's not very complicated for operations (input screen, load profiles, enter data, save data, load previous records, etc.), and the graphics needs are not very sophisticated (very functionally focused). If it was the early 90s, I'd be tempted to even use COBOL. The app will do no calculations or advanced graphics; it's almost entirely a text-based database entry and retrieval function with some flex on forms.

The second need is similar but even simpler in design. It's like **a quiz game.** Questions, with 4 possible answers, timed. It could be used as a game or as a flashcard-type study aid. I have a specific purpose in mind, but the functionality is basically that of a trivia game -- load small database (say 25 Qs about topic 1), go through the Qs, have options for hints or retries, get score at end, equivalent of a global leader board (so some internet required). But all single player, not live games with others, no live online element. And the extra twist for this one is I would love to be able to do it in iOS, Android, AND a version for my website for those who DO have access. The mobile apps would work differently, and I don't NEED a website version, but I'll keep my options open.

The FAQ tells me to use Kotlin or Java (for Android); Objective-C or Swift (for iOS); C#, VB or JS for Windows Phone; or use PhoneGap / Titanium in HTML/CSS/JS. Oh and C# for the Windows PC version (no, I am NOT going to try MAC too).

But with my specific two-use functionality...is that the way to go? I'm fine to learn new tricks, just want to make sure I'm learning the right tricks."

in practice, the array-based implementations are still faster for most applications because arrays allocate memory addresses sequentially while linked list nodes have, for all intents and purposes, random memory addresses. This means fewer page->frame translations need to be stored in the TLB, making the array implementation more efficient. This is not to mention the extra memory overhead of two extra pointers In the linked representations of lists and deques.

I’m struggling with my data structures and algorithms course in uni. This is kind of my last resort for help. I was thinking I might even hire a tutor at this point.
I really want to learn this, so I've watched lectures and followed tutorials, but I feel stuck in a cycle of confusion and I’m hoping for some guidance on how to break out of it.

A lot of my high school math is rusty as well, so I’ve been relearning on the fly.

When I see the pseudocode or a solution, I can usually understand it at a surface level but when I'm given a problem, I blank on how to even start designing the algorithm. It feels like there's a gap between recognizing a solution and inventing one.

I see the final algorithm, but the problem-solving process that led to it feels like a mystery. What mental steps should I be practicing?

What I'm struggling with so far:

* Foundational Math (Floor/Ceiling, Powers, Logarithms). I understand what a log is, but feeling its impact in binary search is different.
* Algorithm Principles & Efficiency (Time/Space Complexity, Big-O). Is Big O notation like a set formula?
* Arrays (Operations, Insertion/Deletion)
* Searching (Linear, Binary Search)
* Basic Algorithms (Array Merging)

I'd really appreciate any help. I'm a visual learner so if you can recommend any YouTube channels or websites that are exceptional at teaching the problem-solving process would be great. Something that kinda holds your hand through the why before the how.  I'd also like to know how you personally learnt to think algorithmically. Are there specific practices (like a certain way of using pseudocode, drawing diagrams, etc.) that helped you?

Please help me find an effective way to practice and learn this."

I’m a 3rd-year BTech CSE student and currently at a beginner level overall.
My long-term goal is to work at big tech / product-based companies like google, and I’ve decided to start preparing seriously from now.

I understand that **DSA is important**, and I’m starting it using **Python**, but I also keep hearing that **DSA alone is not enough**. I want to build my preparation the *right way from scratch*.

I’d really appreciate guidance on:

* **How should a beginner approach DSA from absolute basics?** (concept-first vs problem-first)
* **Where should I learn DSA from the basics?** (free/paid courses, YouTube, books, practice platforms)
* How much DSA is realistically enough for big tech interviews
* What other skills matter alongside DSA (projects, development, CS fundamentals, internships, open source, etc.)
* How to balance DSA with projects and core CS subjects
* Common mistakes beginners make while preparing for big companies

I can dedicate around 3-5 **hours daily** and have about **1 year of time**.
I’m not looking for shortcuts  just practical advice from people who’ve already been through this journey.

Thanks in advance"

I want to do cool side projects that other studetns are doing, be good enough to create my own startup, and build my portfolio and knowledge in general. Obviously job hunting is important, but that just comes with my knowledge skill and expertise.

Recently watched this guy named Gabriel Petersson talking about the importance of diving into things and trying making it over watching lectures over and over. I want to be independent from school and learn some things myself.

I am really interested in learning how to code and more importantly create software. With the emergence of ai tools like cursor I feel like it’s easier than ever to make software. But I also heard that vibe coding has its limitations and the best way to approach coding with ai is to learn how to code first. So I started taking Harvards cs50p which is an introduction to python, then after that I plan on taking cs50x which is an introduction to computer science course and then after that I want to take their web development course. But after taking all these courses I am still unsure how if I would be able to detect the errors that ai creates such as over coding, apparently a lot ai code has security vulnerabilities, being able to read ai code and spot bugs, architecture apparently is another problem I heard. On my free time I also spend quite a bit of time learning about how software interacts with databases, tech stacks, and also architecture. My overall question is am I on the right track? Or should I implement other methods to help me on this journey? I know my current route is not going to make me a genius in coding but the idea is that I would have a good enough background to start creating projects where I can truly learn."

For context, I am currently working on a little Latain learning side project and I am trying to setup a specific subclass for that. The background is that latin has a lot of suffixes that occur under a combination of properties that the given word has. The two properties that are currently of interest for me are the Numerus (an Enum) and the Casus (another Enum).

My first instinct was to create a two dimensional array for that, but I quickly realised that this will lead to confusion problems if I don't know at any given point in time in which order the suffixes are actually placed into the array, because they aren't linked to the values of the Enum directly.

To circumvent this, I quickly figured out that I actually wanted to use the values of the Enum directly and map specific values in a table like fashion to them, basically like:
(Singular, Nominative, ""us"")
(Singular, Accusative, ""um"")

So I wrote this class here:
https://github.com/Hellinfernel/Latin-Learing-Program/blob/main/latin%2FBiEnumMap.java#L19

Now the thing is I still don't have any idea if my approach here is even technically doable because I don't know how to get an collection of all the values of an given Enum class.

I tried EnumSet and Enum directly, but none of that seemed to really function and I couldn't find a function in the docs that fulfilled my requirements, and I feel like I am either completely and utterly blind or am just not searching in the right place.

I am pretty sure my code has other problems as well, but for now I just would like to know the following:

How do I get a list of all values of a given Enum class to use them as an index for a map?"

I’m not asking whether it’s theoretically possible. I want to know if it’s realistic for someone just starting out.

Specifically, I’m wondering:

What types of contributions are beginner friendly (code, documentation, tests, triage)?

How steep is the learning curve in large projects?

Is it more efficient to start with smaller projects before tackling major ones?

I’d love to hear experiences from beginners who’ve tried contributing, as well as maintainers or anyone familiar with onboarding new contributors.

My current approach is this:

* Public subpages that don’t need any user-specific data (explore, browse, etc) are accessed via normal navigation (<a href="""">)
* Anything that requires knowing the user (favorites saved things, etc) is loaded via API calls using a fetch wrapper that automatically sends JWT cookies and handles auth

Example:

If I navigate to a public page via <a> the backend doesn’t need to know who I am.

But if I want to load my favorites, that data is fetched through an authenticated api endpoint, where the jwt identifies the user and the backend returns the correct data

If I tried to load something like “favorites” purely via <a>, the server wouldn’t know which user I am since a jwt wouldn´t have been sent, so it makes sense to separate navigation from data access.

Do you think this approach makes sense long-term?

Is this the best approach or a good approach with JWTs or am I missing a better pattern?

What would you do?

I think I asked this somewhere else but answers were also vague. Some even mocked me.

For example, while learning, I code using a simple text editor and compile using the terminal. All I can do with that is print stuff on the terminal. With SDL that I am learning now, I am able to create a window and load images to it. But that is about it. How do people in the real world turn code into something functional like a server or into software that runs on machines?

 I am not an expert in flutter / clean architecture as a whole and I am trying my best to learn through the community , lets go straight to detail : I am using clean architecture to structure my app , but I shopped off a few corners to minimize boilerplate ,

for example I removed use cases , now cubits/ blocs interact directly with the repositories (not sure if this is a deal breaker with clean architecture but so far everything is clean tell me your opinions about that )

so I am going to give you a snippet of code in my app , please review it and identify the mistakes I made and the improvements I could do . packages I am using : getit for di , bloc for state management , drift for data persistance

this is my cars cubit :

    class CarsCubit extends Cubit<CarsState> {
      final CarRepository carRepository;
      final ClientRepositories clientRepositories;
      final ExpensesRepositories expensesRepositories;

      final ReservationsRepository reservationsRepository;

      final AppLogsRepository appLogsRepository;

      final UnitOfWork unitOfWork;

      void createCar({required CreateCarCommand createCarCommand, CancelToken?      cancelToken}) async {
      emit(state.copyWith(status: CarCubitStatus.createCarLoading));

      final response = await unitOfWork.beginTransaction(() async {
        final response = await carRepository.createCarsAsync(
          createCarCommand: createCarCommand,
          cancelToken: cancelToken,
        );

        await appLogRepository.addLogAsync(
          command: CreateLogCommand(logType: AppLogType.createdCar, userId: createCarCommand.userId),
        );

        return response;
      });

      response.fold((l) => emit(state.copyWith()), (r) async {
        final cars = state.cars;
        final carsList = cars.items;

        emit(
          state.copyWith(
            cars: cars.copyWith(items: [r.value, ...carsList]),
            status: CarCubitStatus.createCarSuccess,
          ),
        );
      });
    }

    }

as you can see I have multiple repositories for different purposes , the thing I want to focus on is create car method which simply creates a car object persists it in the db , also it logs the user action via a reactive repository , the logs repository exposes a stream to the logsCubit and it listens to changes and updates the cubit state , these actions need to occur together so all or nothing , so I used a unit of work to start a transaction .

as I said please review the code identify the issues and please give insightful tips"

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1plaqc8/python_typeerror_with_floats_using_gmpy2_library,Python typeerror with floats using gmpy2 library,"Hello, I am new to and testing out the gmpy2 library to eventually use in other python code, but I have ran into some type of TypeError problem.

>**1. What is the problem?**

gmpy2.is\_integer() is saying that floats that are equivalent to a whole number (i.e. 2.0) are integers, but when using gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) with ""whole number"" floats, it raises a TypeError where only integers or rational arguments are allowed.

>**1. What is your code supposed to do?**

Currently, I'm just testing simple mathematics operations and learning the gmpy2 library. My code is supposed to check what the type of input is for 2 numbers you select (through gmpy2.is\_integer() ), and do either gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) for integers, or do gmpy2.div(x, y) for floats.

>**2. What is your code doing instead?**

See: ""1. What is the problem?""

>**3. What inputs, if any, cause the problem?**

Floats and gmpy2.mpfr() created floats that are equivalent to whole numbers, like 2.0.

>**4. Is there an error message of some kind? If so, include it.**

Yes: TypeError: qdiv() requires 1 or 2 integer or rational arguments

>**2. What have you tried?**

I can easily use the normal python isinstance(x, float), convert ""whole number"" floats to integers, or just use gmpy2.div(x, y) or some other division, but that is not the problem. The problem is with gmpy2.is\_integer() and/or gmpy2.qdiv(x, y).

For the code, I have tried using the first number as a float, the second number for a float, both numbers as floats, and those three combinations as gmpy2.mpfr() floats as well.

>**1. What have you already tried to debug your own problem? Where do you suspect the problem is? What uncertainties do you have?**

Printing gmpy2.is\_integer(x) and gmpy2.is\_integer(y) both return True when both x and y are ""whole number"" floats, and then gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) raises the TypeError, so I'd say the problem would be when I use gmpy2.is\_integer() or gmpy2.qdiv(x, y).

>**2. What precisely are you confused by?**

I am confused that gmpy2.is\_integer() is saying that ""whole number"" floats are integers, but then gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) says I'm not using integers.

>**3. Have you tried googling for answers? If so, what search queries have you tried? What pages have you read? What do you find confusing about them?**

I have like 20 tabs open that are gmpy2 docs, and various searches with different ways to ask about my problem. For example: ""gmpy2 is\_integer"", ""gmpy2 qdiv"", ""gmpy2 qdiv with whole number floats"", and ""Why does gmpy2.is\_integer() returns True for ""whole number"" mpfr floats if gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) cannot use them?"". For the last search, I got exactly 2 results, both of which are just gmpy2 documentation.

On the gmpy2 docs, is\_integer() → bool. Return True if x is an integer; False otherwise, and gmpy2.qdiv(*x*, *y=1*, */*) → mpz| mpq. Return x/y as mpz if possible, or as mpq if x is not exactly divisible by y.

I am aware that gmpy2.is\_integer() returns True is a float checked is equivalent to a whole number. I am also aware that gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) only works on integer and rational arguments.

So what I'm confused about is why gmpy2.is\_integer() returns True for ""whole number"" floats if gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) cannot use them.

>**DO** be sure to actually ask a question.

Why does gmpy2.is\_integer() returns True for ""whole number"" floats if gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) cannot use them?

>Anyways, here's the actual code

    import gmpy2

    def test(x, y):
        rlist = []
        z = gmpy2.mul(x, y)
        rlist.append(z)
        h = gmpy2.add(x, y)
        rlist.append(h)
        if gmpy2.is_integer(x) and gmpy2.is_integer(y) is True:
            print (gmpy2.is_integer(x))
            print (gmpy2.is_integer(y))
            j = gmpy2.qdiv(x, y)
            rlist.append(j)
        else:
            i = gmpy2.div(x, y)
            rlist.append(i)
        return rlist

I have just completed algorithms & data structures class (generally the 3rd CS class you take here) and so far everything we've done has been in java with a bit of python.

Our games department does not have any specific programming classes because the assumption is that most of that will be handled by the CS department, however the main engine we use for the game dev classes is UE5 which runs in C++. There is a games scripting class that I've just completed but that's all using blueprints.

Advice I'm seeing tends to be either to read a specific book/forum (which tends to be a \*very\* slow method for me, safe to say I'm generally an audiobook person) or to just ""go and start"", which I can grab a compiler and start googling how something formatted in java is formatted in c++, but that doesn't give me as good of an understanding.

I read that to do that I should used cmake, but after looking at tutorials for a few hours, I couldn't seem to wrap my head around this whole thing.

Q1: Do I need to manually write the cmake file everytime in for a new project or everytime I want to add a library either from vcpkg or elsewhere?(and why are there so many small details and keywords?) Some tutorials say that vscode has a tool to help with this, but it make the cmake file for me after all... or did I do something wrong?

Q2: How do I learn how to use the vcpkg libraries? Like about some specific library. The documentations looks so complex and doesn't explain much sometimes."

should I go for MCA or MBA? Both require a serious grind and I’m fine with hard work… but the real fear is:
what if i spend 2-3 years of life and output sucks

around me some guys went full self-taught
1500 DSA questions, full-stack projects, tons of certificates, everything…
and they’re still stuck at 5–7 LPA.
They keep saying, *“Don’t get into tech bro, Market bekar hai.”*

But on the other side, I see people building tech startups and literally changing their entire life… and then the FOMO hits me — like maybe I should try tech too.

Then I think about MBA… if I don’t get a good college, placements become average.
And MCA… heavy coding. What if I can’t break into a good job?

Plus I’ve seen relatives running IT service companies without even knowing how to code… and still making money.
So freelancing/services look like an option too, but I don’t know if it’s reliable today or not.

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pjp5q7/i_realized_i_do_like_programming_i_just_hate,I realized i do like programming i just hate,"Programming is definitely one of the hardest subjects to MASTER in life. It's certainly the hardest thing for me to grasp. And when I say ""master"", I mean, getting to that point where you're confident in programming apps with little to no lookups. Getting to that point where you can confidently pass live coding interviews.

This is the point where I strive to get to, and the only way to do this is by actually learning the material. Hopefully some can relate when I say programming is very much enjoyable when you understand every bit of your code, but it gets frustrating if you have gaps in your knowledge and don't understand certain pieces of your code.

When you understand every bit of it, you can literally lay on your bed and figure out the error in your head. If you take shortcuts it's much harder to do so, and you'll end up being at the point where you don't know if you can solve the error no matter how much time you have.

I made this post to hopefully motivate you guys to actually learn the material, in which many of you are if you're in this sub.

TLDR: If you actually learn the material live coding interviews will be a much smoother process(obviously), and coding will be much more enjoyable since you'll actually feel capable of debugging your app. The only way to get rid of imposter syndrome is by actually proving to yourself that you can do the work, don't take shortcuts.

Edit: I also came to the realization that it is highly unlikely to ""master"" programming in the way I depicted it out to be. You won't be able to program everything without looking something up but there's nothing wrong with that. As long as you understand every bit of your code, then that's what matters."

I'm talking about captcha's, payment processing, form validation, etc. all the stuff that you would usually handle in your ""Backend's"" api.

Now I would say I do know how to do this sort of stuff in backends like express however, but I've seen online that using a BaaS such as supabase, firebase, pocketbase, etc. are better for speeding up development.

But things such as pocketbase have little documentation on how to implement this sort of stuff, and even supabase it's still a decent process.

So I'm saying why would it be worth using a BaaS when your site/application requires a bit more of these advanced features. BaaS sounds good for authentication and a database, but besides that it seems actually more difficult to configure a backend using a BaaS.

(addressing the sub guidelines)

1. Your content is high-quality: I think it is - the book covers a range of Qt widgets. All examples are self-contained, each followed with step-by-step instructions and code walkthroughs.

2. Your content is reasonably complete: It is. The chapters on Qt widgets can be followed as a complete unit. Same with the multithreading chapters. Both units provide a reasonably complete coverage of the topics.

3. Your content is specifically about helping beginners learn programming: The Qt widgets chapters provide a series of beginner-friendly examples accompanied by approachable explanations. The multithreading part is an intermediate topic but written in a way that should be helpful to learners.

4. Your content is easy to sample and assess: All finished chapters are available as a single PDF file that you can download by clicking ""Read Free Sample"" button on the book home page.

5. Your post body contains more then just a link: If anything the post is too long

6. You disclose your affiliation to the resource: I am not affiliate to anything. I am writing this book for fun in my spare time."

It’s making me wonder if I’m just slow or if others go through this too. How do you all internalize this stuff? Any tips on moving from “looking up everything” to actually writing code from memory? and understanding how solve questions?"

Then once my assets have been moved, each asset (except assets I have moved to create the new line angle) will move back to its relative position (using the distance field).

So instead I’m looking for infra that’s more solo dev friendly. Is there a common stack that solo devs use?

* [fly.io](http://fly.io) for a virtual machine, and just running containers in it.
* running caddy for TLS termination and static file serving
* dart / shelf for backend
* SQLite for DB
* back blaze for blob storage
* namecheap for domain hosting

With this setup I should be able to run it under $50 / year and have hard budget limits. Obviously I would need to scale if my project got traffic, but I’ll deal with that if it hits."

As during the mid-Sem I failed the hurdle for python, therefore I had to leave the course. My final results came and I failed the finals for Haskell.

Furthermore, someone told me new programmers should not learn two different paradigms together, but next Sem I still have to redo the Haskell course, and a Stat course which uses R programming language. So, as I am in vacations now I decided to start learning Java on my own using Neso-academy and W3school. Because there are a lot of resources available for Java online. And another advise I got is if one learns one language like Java, or C, it is quite easy to pick up new languages. And then after Haskell my college mainly uses Java, and the courses for Java are said to be quite hard, and fast paced. I have vacations from Dec to end of January.

I wanted if anyone can advise me on to learn programming in an effective way. As during the semester I was only able to see the lectures, and what ever they did in the lectures, I tried to replicate it own my on. Like, I would end up spending 6hrs to complete a 1 hour lecture in Haskell. Python was easier but then I ended up paying more attention in Haskell as it is a course I must learn for the degree. And in general I really interested in technology, so if anyone can guide me I will be really grateful.

I'm currently an **Electronics major** student, but I'm looking to pivot my career path to become a **Python Developer**. I'm highly motivated and actively self-learning.

While my major gives me a strong foundation in **hardware, circuit analysis, and logic design** [attachment_0](attachment), I lack the traditional Computer Science (CS) degree.

**My Questions for the community are:**

1.  **Best Entry Point:** Considering my background in Electronics, would my best starting point be in areas that combine hardware and software, such as **Embedded Systems, IoT development**, or **Robotics** using Python? Or should I aim for a more mainstream area like **Web Development (Django/Flask)**?
2.  **CS Fundamentals:** How critical is it for me to study traditional CS topics (like Algorithms and Data Structures) versus focusing heavily on Python frameworks and practical development skills?
3.  **Transferable Skills:** How can I best highlight my Electronics knowledge (e.g., analytical thinking, problem-solving from circuit debugging) as a strength on my resume for a software role?
4.  **Portfolio Projects:** What kind of Python projects would bridge the gap between Electronics/Hardware and Software and be attractive to recruiters?

I’ve been learning C through ***C Programming: A Modern Approach*** (up until chapter **15**). I started the book because:

1. C was being used in our lessons (my first programming class).

2. I heard C is a really good first language for learning programming fundamentals. (mostly from subreddits lol)

Now that our classes are switching to Java next semester, studying C feels kind of boring, especially since we don’t use it in class anymore. I want to go into web development / fullstack, where C isn’t really used, and I feel like I’ve already learned the essentials such as loops, types, functions, pointers, arrays, strings, etc.

So I’m wondering: does it make sense to keep diving deeper into C at this point? My concern is that studying C more might just make me better at C itself, rather than teaching me concepts that are applicable across most PLs.

My plan is to focus on Java for college and eventually frontend and backend development. I’m just not sure if spending more time on C is worth it now, especially since I don’t feel as motivated as I did when it was part of our class.

Should I keep going with C, or focus on Java and web development instead?"

If I get stuck, I google the specific part and keep going.

A friend told me this is a “bad habit,” because a “real programmer” should build things from scratch without checking someone else’s code first. And that even if I manage to finish, it doesn’t count because I saw an example.

Lecturer said that there exists a mathematical properly, can't figure it out, don't even know how to think about this problem.

In my code I tried to solve it with reachability matrix, the issue was that it does not guarantee that all tiles will be walked on, I tried to build the map as nodes, connected to other nodes and would disconnect the connections related to the direction I want to disallow, that however made me question how the hell am I supposed to check if I can walk through all of them. A recursive function would branch, causing wrong output, I also can't find more deterministic approach to checking.

Example inputs where recursive function fails due to branching:

I am aware most competitive programming occurs in C++, but I want to avoid learning syntax and programming all over again, as I am most fluent in python. The main concern that I have is that the programs need to run in under 1 second, which I dont know is possible.

How do you evaluate your code? I am trying to write stuff but I can never understand if it's jank or do people write like this or if there is performance to be squeezed out. I tried LLMs but I think they are brown nosing me a bit. If you do use AI, how do you use it?

How to profile code (C++/pytoch/python)? I am using VS code but I don't see any clear solutions. Any reference would help. I need help with both tooling and how to use said tools.

This project came to me when I was bored in history class. I feel like this is a really interesting side project, since I was able to finish it in a couple days, yet I have learnt a lot of stuff:

* I tried picking correct data structures;
* I learned a lot about serialization with SQLite;
* I learned about the XDG desktop standard, and where I should store data;

I would really appreciate if you looked into my code - the source code is small, and overall takes up just a bit over 300 lines of code. Any feedback (hopefully unfiltered) would be greatly appreciated - I want to know each and every place where I messed up, since that is what learning projects are for.

The goal:
Write a menu-driven Python program that lets a user choose a geometric shape, enter the required dimensions, and then prints both the area and perimeter (or circumference for a circle). After showing results, the program must loop back to the menu until the user types “quit” (case-insensitive accepted: quit, Quit, QUIT, etc.).
Program requirements:
-Show a menu each cycle with these exact options:
  •square
  •rectangle
  •rhombus
  •circle
  •trapezoid
  •quit(exits program)
-Accept the user’s choice as text
-After printing results, redisplay the menu
-Use functions: at minimum, a function per shape and a main() function with the loop
-Use if __name__ == “__main__”: main()

The problem I am having is calling the main() function under if __name__ == “__main__”. main() will not execute under this, however, whenever I call main() by itself, it will run. Which led me to my second problem. Whenever I call main() it will loop without printing results until I type quit or 6 to exit the program, to which it then prints all the results.

I have a C++ app that simulates conway's game of life in 3D based on user-inputted .txt files, the program also produces output.txt files from the simulation. I'm using SFML and OpenGL for graphics

Should I put all user facing files (The .exe, SFML .dlls and .txt files) in a subdirectory of the project, isolated from the source files ? (unitary tests, .obj files, .cpp and headers)
I'm thinking about putting user-facing files in a separate folder like output/ or something. can someone tell me if the following reasoning is correct ?

The program creates most of the files in output/ (.exe ...ect), but the folder already has some files by default (.dlls, predefined example states for conway's game of life)

Should I push the whole filesystem to github ? or just the user-facing files ? is that the difference between ""open-source"" projects and ""closed-source"" projects ?

If possible I'd really love some recommandations on what is typical or standard in a C++ project like this, from people with more experience, any help is appreciated.

(as a sidenote, I just now did a mingw32-make clean command which deleted my whole user-facing folder along with every inital state .txt file contained within, so I probably need to change the way I compile my code)

Here's my current folder strucure (based on a dir -s command)

I’m 29 and I’ve been working as a frontend developer for about five years. Lately, I’ve been feeling stuck: my current company no longer offers growth opportunities, either financially or professionally. Overall, it feels like a stagnant situation.

This has been weighing on me for a while and I feel like 2026 might be the right year to make a change, starting with improving my English, but also taking a serious step forward in my career.

A bit of context about the situation here in Italy:

* Being specialized only in frontend isn’t a highly in-demand skill.
* On top of that, I keep receiving job offers with salaries that are honestly discouraging and make me feel undervalued.

That said, I want to invest both in my English and in my technical skills, but I’m not sure which direction to take. Here are some of the ideas I'm considering:

* Buying several courses on Udemy and studying deeply to strengthen my knowledge, improve my CV and hopefully find better opportunities.
* Looking into more structured, higher-quality courses (I’m willing to spend a few thousand euros if it’s truly worth it) that might offer stronger guarantees or even connections with companies. I know that in some fields these programs help people land jobs quickly, but I’m not sure if this model works in IT.
* Broadening or diversifying my skill set: learning Three.js to specialize in a niche area, moving toward a full-stack role or even switching to game development, which has always interested me. I’m also open to exploring other promising or highly-requested fields.

For context, I don’t have a university degree. I’m also seriously considering relocating abroad, actually, that’s one of my main dreams right now, because I’d really like to gain international experience.

What do you think?

3) Intermediate Python

However the problem is I’d have to make a system for logging in, keep track of teams, rosters, stats, players, real time progression, and I don’t know how how running an online game really works like will I need some kind of server? How much will a server cost?

Do yall think its reasonable to learn this stuff on the fly or is as difficult as I’m thinking it’s going to be because I’m not very experienced"

Thing is at work our code base is just bad, we do not have quality code and unit tests are like ""write them only if you want"" and the ones that are there are unfinished and no one really takes the time to document/explain. When I try to do a backend task I get anxious and I normally rely on copilot for (i know i should not). But also I feel like even if i put the effort the code will not be appreciated. It is the typical ""do now, we fix later"" and later never comes.

I know this is a personal preference to be good at something as most work places do not care about code quality.

In many public benchmarks, Go comes out ahead in certain categories, despite the JVM’s reputation for aggressive optimization and mature JIT technology. On the other hand, Java dominates in long-running, throughput-heavy workloads. The contrast between reputation and published results seems worth examining.

A recurring question is how much weight different benchmarks should have when evaluating these systems. Some emphasize microbenchmarks, others highlight real-world workloads, and some argue that the JVM only shows its strengths under specific conditions such as long warm-up phases or complex allocation patterns.

Rather than asking for tutorials or explanations, I’m interested in opening a discussion about \*\*how the Java community evaluates performance claims today\*\* — e.g., which benchmark suites are generally regarded as meaningful, what workloads best showcase JVM characteristics, and how people interpret comparisons with languages like Go.

When I thought about changing careers last time I still overlooked an MS in CS because I just thought I wasn’t someone capable of it.

My current career is very stable and comfortable, but I can shake the itch to learn coding and be an SWE in some capacity. I love to create, build, and problem solve, and I’ve become deeply fascinated with AI. I did some searching and saw it isn’t totally unfathomable to be a self-taught SWE.

I’ve already built out a roadmap to learn some languages (starting with Python) and build some projects to try and transition careers to a backend role. I’ve been going at it for a few weeks and really love it, and spend most of my free time learning.

That said, the idea of teaching myself a skill and transitioning into a new industry still sounds a bit optimistic sometimes, especially in the current job market. Seeing as I am still in grad school, I won’t have the money to get another MS for a while which is why i’m opting for self-taught.

I know there are success stories of people switching careers into SWE, and I have seen some great insight on this and similar subs, but I’d love to get any guidance and/or inspiration from anyone with a similar background to mine on how they navigated transitioning careers as a self-taught programmer.

A good example of this is when I found some fairly basic code somewhere (the context & specifics of which I've forgotten) that created a ""new Main"" object. This threw me for a loop, as I've really just seen ""Main"" as a container for code that runs when starting a program, and never considered it as an object. I also then realized I have no clue what the ""(String[] args)"" bit means in the main method.

So, why are the ""basics"" of programming languages (or again, maybe just Java) things like printing ""hello world"" before you deeply understand what a class is and why the print command is in one?

Post-script: A few other examples of being taught a specific use for something without knowing what it does exactly
(Side note: ""for some reason"" here just means I didn't know the reason, not that it's unreasonable)

- Printing text, which for some reason requires me to add ""System.out."" beforehand
- Creating a Scanner object to read user text input, which for some reason requires me to specify ""(System.in)""
- Catching all errors, which for some reason requires me to specify ""(Exception e)""
- Fixing a Scanner after inputting a number so it correctly takes text input, which for some reason is as simple as executing the command "".nextLine()""

EDIT: The (quite helpful!) responses to this were a lot longer than I expected lol, I believe my questions have been answered. Thank you!"

Basically there are 11-12 dominoes for you to place inside a randomly-generated grid. Each piece of domino can rotate freely. All grids must be filled, and must fit the constraints (e.g. 3 cells need to be different, 4 cells add up to 17, etc...)

At first the game is interesting, then I tried to dig into the coding details behind it (where I cannot think at all). I have two main questions:

1. How is the board generated? (Note: the holes can sometimes be in a loop (like today), or be jammed all together into a irregular piece, or a regular piece, so it can't be simply like a grid)

2. How do you verify that there is only one placement on the board? (i.e. how do you build a constraint solver such that you can verify there is only this solution?)

2b. How to quantify the difficulty of a puzzle? (steps needed to solve? How many possible combinations?)

\--my thoughts--

For my first question, I thought of generating e.g. a 8x8 grid, then deleting all the empty spaces, but how do I ensure that sufficient amount of dominoes stick together and form a clump, instead of discrete dominoes floating inside the grid?

For my second question, of course I can write a program to test all the combinations, but factoring in the orientation of the dominoes, there are at least 12! \* 4 (1.9 billion) placements, and it can be displaced (AB , CD) vs (XA, BC, DX), so its much more than that."

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1phbony/cant_decide_between_c_and_java_for_backend_need,Cant decide between c and java for backend need,"I can’t decide which programming language to choose. My dilemma: C# or Java? I want to become a backend developer. I know the differences between these languages, and I’m familiar with the syntax of both. But I need to pick one so I can move forward: learn the frameworks, build pet projects, and eventually find a job. Some people might say: “Just pick one, and you can switch later. It won’t take much time.” But for me, as someone who is still learning, switching would cost a lot of time — learning a new framework, building a new project, and preparing again for interviews. I like C# and its ecosystem. But I’ve heard online and from a developer I know (he works with Kotlin) that C# is used in a narrow range of tasks — more like a “plug” inside big projects. So I’m afraid I’ll end up working on small or insignificant parts instead of medium or large projects. I’m from Ukraine, and here the number of C# and Java vacancies is roughly the same. But I want to work abroad. For example, in Canada I see around 200–300 .NET vacancies, and around 900 Java ones. In the US, depending on the region, .NET has about 200–300 openings, while Java has 1,000–2,000. Maybe I’m filtering incorrectly, but maybe that’s the real picture. It looks like C# roles are two or three times less common, which probably means fewer interesting projects. But the internet is full of conflicting opinions: some recommend C# for the backend, while others trash it. It seemed like the obvious choice: Java. Just pick Java and be done with it. But the choice isn't so simple for me. Perhaps I seem strange with my dilemma. Besides, I don't have anyone to talk to for advice."

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1phhcdy/teaching_pain_point,Teaching pain point,"Some quick background: I work a community college as an IT Academic support specialist.  Basically I'm 4 parts tutor, 1 part psuedo-teachers aide (times however many IT class sections there are), and 5 parts curriculum development/feed back.  One aspect of my job involves running open study/work sessions that students can attend to ask questions about different things, and get help with assignments. I run these sessions through zoom room because when I surveyed the classes at the beginning of the semester, Wednesday from 8pm to 10pm was selected by the most students as the preferred time but our office is only physically open until 5pm.

I had just finished such a session, closed out the room, filled out my reports, and was getting ready to go to bed when I received a notice about a message from a student. They are having trouble completing an assignment. I looked at the assignment to get an idea of how complex it was and from that gauge weather this should be a 5 minute thing or a 30 minute thing. The assignment is that the students have an array of names. They need to write the code that will allow the user to input a number and return the name at that index or if the number it out of bounds, return the name at the closest index. So pretty straight forward beginners exercise to get you start working with arrays. Should be pretty quick. I ask the student to send me a screen cap of their code.

You know the saying ""You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make 'em drink""? I'm pretty certain that this student would wind up dying of thirst next to the watering hole. I look at the students code and don't see any issues with it. I copy the code over to my ide, and run a half dozen tests. it works just fine. I ask the student to explain exactly what ZyBooks is reporting when they submit the assignment for grading. They respond saying they are getting 2/5 tests wrong.

Okay... that is even more bizarre. If they weren't converting the input to an int, or not correcting for 0 or something like that, they would fail off the tests. Not some of them. The only way they could fail some of them but not others is if they are somehow returning the wrong index's value. So I ask for a screen cap of the results screen. It takes a couple minutes to figure out what the problem is... or rather why the problem is occurring. Basically ZyBooks is expecting the name in the last place of the array to be 'Tyrese' so if the system checks for the last name, or checks for any index beyond the last location, it should get the name 'Tyrese'. Except in the student's code, the last name is the array isn't 'Tyrese', it's 'Luna'.

Now the only way this could happen is if the student changed the contents of the array. And here is where my typical approach to helping students really bit me in the ass. I try to avoid programming students direct answers and instead try to guide them to understanding the situation by using leading questions. I think it is important to help them build up not only their own problem solving skills but also their self-confidence. So while I could have spent 30 seconds and told the student ""You changed the content of the array so the values ZyBooks is looking for aren't present. You need to change the last name back to 'Tyrese' "" I figured I'd spend 3 minutes leading them to that conclusion. Please remember that this following exchange is taking place via canvas Inbox messaging. So assume at least 2 minutes between each message.

**me:** Did you change the content of the array?
**student:** No.
**me:** Really? So Luna was always the last name in the array?
**student**: No. I added it.
**me:** You added it to the array? But did you change or remove any of the names that were already there when you started?
**student**: No.
**me:** So the array didn't have Tyrese when you started the assignment?
**student**: Well yeah, but I like the name Luna more.
**me:** So you replaced Tyrese with Luna then?
**student**: Yeah. I like the name 'Luna' more then 'Tyrese'.
**Me:** Okay... well ZyBooks is testing your code with the understanding that that the 9th entry in the list is ""Tyrese"", not ""Luna"".
**Student:** So... do I need to change my input?
**Me:** No. Your input is fine. Your program is actually working correctly. It's just working with an array that is different then what ZyBooks thinks it's working with.
**Student:** So why does it say it' wrong?
**Me:** Look at test number 3. You program displays the name ""Luna"" because it is the value at index 8. But ZyBooks is testing your program believing that the 9th entry in the list is 'Tyrese'.
**Student:** Oh... so do I need to change the name of my exception?
**Me:** No, your exception is fine. The issue is that your list of names is different then the list of names that ZyBook thinks you have. ZyBooks is expecting the 9th entry to be ""Tyrese"". What is the 9th entry in your list?
**Student:** Luna.
**Me**: Okay, and what entry is 'Tyrese' ?
**Student**: I don't have a Tyrese in my list.
**Me**: Right. So if ZyBooks is expecting the your program to show the name 'Tyrese' when it calls for index 8 and your program shows the name at index 8 is ""Luna"" it's going to say it's wrong.
**Student:** do I need a loop?
**Me:** No. If ZyBooks wants to see the name ""Tyrese"" what index number would it need to supply?
**Student**: There is no Tyrese in the list.
**Me**: Right. But Zybooks doesn't know that. It just knows that your program is showing something that isn't ""Tyrese"" when it looks at index 8. So if your program is going to show ""Tyrese"" when it looks at index 8, what needs to be at index 8 of your list?
**Student**: do I need to use a string for my input?
**Me**: no... ZyBooks is expecting the 9th entry in your list to be ""Tyrese"". What entry is 'Tyrese' in your list?
**Student**: I replaced it with Luna.
**Me**: okay, that's not what I asked. I asked what entry is 'Tyrese' in your list? What number index does it need to get ""Tyrese"" from your list?
**Student**: I don't have a Tyrese in my list.
**Me**: So how is your program going to display the name ""Tyrese"" if it's not in your list? Student: Well.... it can't.
**Me**: Right. So you need to fix your list so that it has the names ZyBooks is expecting it have. Student: What do you mean?
**Me**: ZyBooks is expecting the name at index 8 of your list to be ""Tyrese"".
Student: Right I replaced it with Luna.
**Me**: Right. Which means anytime the program looks to see if index 8 contains ""Tyrese"" it's going to show the name ""Luna"" which is not ""Tyrese"" so it's going to say that is wrong.
**Student**: okay... so do I need to change the name of the list?
**Me**: no... you need to change the names that in the list. so that the 9th name is ""Tyrese"", not ""Luna"".
**Student**: I changed it to ""Luna"".
**Me**: yes... you need to change it back to 'Tyrese'
**Student**: But I don't like the name Tyrese.
**Me**: ZyBooks isn't asking what you like."

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ph4jvf/api_request_with_particle_photon_2_opensky,Api request with particle photon 2 opensky,"Hello,

I don't really know where to go with this project. It seemed simple enough. Isn't working, and and I'm not sure why. I've put in a request to the OpenSky discord but figured if it turns out to be a more technical problem, this might be the place? I'm hoping since there's such a large base here someone might know something useful, or at least refer me to a more...suitable sub-reddit. Anyways:

I'm working on a project for my Physical Computing Class and I'm trying ultimately trying to use the OpenSky API to display where planes are above my school with an LED strip. The webhook is being called by my Particle Photon 2 microcontroller, then the same microcontroller is listening for the JSON in response.

I'm, however, getting stuck with the API request.

Here is the link to the endpoint: [opensky-network.org/api/states/all?lamin=41.96414&lomin=-88.22404&lamax=41.96850&lomax=-87.59579](https://opensky-network.org/api/states/all?lamin=41.96414&lomin=-88.22404&lamax=41.96850&lomax=-87.59579)
Here is the link to the API Documentation: [openskynetwork.github.io](https://openskynetwork.github.io/opensky-api/rest.html)

Here is the code for the Particle that should: pull the JSON from the API request and print it.

    #include <ArduinoJson.h>

    JsonDocument doc;

    void setup()
    {
        Serial.begin(9600);

        while(Particle.disconnected()); //stops requests while booting

        Serial.println(""Particle connected to cloud!"");
        Particle.subscribe(""hook-response/getFlights"", extractInfo);
    }

    void loop()
    {
        delay(10000);
        Serial.println(""Fetching data..."");
        Particle.publish(""getFlights"");
        Serial.println(""Loop complete."");
    }

    void extractInfo(const char *event, const char *data)
    {
        Serial.println(""Handler is starting..."");

        DeserializationError error = deserializeJson(doc, data);

        if (error) {
            Serial.print(""deserializeJson() failed: "");
            Serial.println(error.c_str());
            return;
        }

        JsonVariant valueToPrint = doc[""states""][0][1];

        Serial.print(""Extracted Value: "");
        serializeJson(valueToPrint, Serial);
        Serial.println();
    }

Here is my webhook JSON:

    {
        ""name"": ""getFlights"",
        ""event"": ""getFlights"",
        ""deviceID"": ""0a10aced202194944a0553bc"",
        ""disabled"": false,
        ""template"": ""webhook"",
        ""url"": ""https://opensky-network.org/api/states/all?lamin=41.96414&lomin=-88.22404&lamax=41.96850&lomax=-87.59579"",
        ""requestType"": ""GET"",
        ""noDefaults"": true,
        ""rejectUnauthorized"": true,
        ""responseTemplate"": """",
        ""unchunked"": false,
        ""data_url_response_event"": false,
        ""auth"": {
            ""username"": ""yaboyluke2"",
            ""password"": ""[hidden]""
        }
    }

And here is what I'm getting:

From the webhook:

    Error Message
    A detailed message about what went wrong

    ETIMEDOUT
    Event
    The source event that triggered the webhook

    {
      ""name"": ""getFlights"",
      ""data"": """",
      ""ttl"": 60,
      ""published_at"": ""2025-12-08T04:47:46.981Z"",
      ""coreid"": ""0a10aced202194944a0553bc""
    }

From Serial Output:

    Connected to USB serial
    Particle connected to cloud!
    Fetching data...
    Loop complete.

    Fetching data...
    Loop complete.
    Fetching data...
    Loop complete.

Im not really getting much to work with here, but based on the ""ETIMEDOUT"" and the fact that there's no error codes being printed or data leaves me to believe that the API is just denying my request? Maybe? I dont know.

To try and fix the problem I have tried to make a separate webhook to get a AuthToken from the Particle then use that to make the request, however that didn't seem to work so I reverted to the simpler code above. If you would like to see that, I don't know if I have the webhook anymore but I can show you the old code.

I'm really not sure what's going on and any help would be great. I think its gotta be something with the fact that the microcontroller is calling it because I've successfully accessed the data through terminal and with a chrome browser. Let me know if y'all have any questions.

All the frickin curl in the documentation isn't helpful to me lol. If somebody can help me try to figure out why I’m not getting any data outputs that would be great. If you manage to find the and fix the part of my code that is stopping this that’s even better.

Thanks for your help!

*PS: I put in way more requests than I intended to but I know it didn't go over 4,000. So that shouldn't be a problem. Assuming I'm not messing up the auth part.*"

I have spent the afternoon, trying to wrap my head round a basic ORM, for a small side project I am working on (basic CRUD console app).

My question is where do these ORM things fit in, in real life. I can sort of see the simplicity of them. However, maybe I am out of touch here. But I thought, with products such as SQL Server, you created your schema using SQL.

In fact, at my work, I know we have a third party company that one of our clients uses, that regularly runs SQL scripts on a SQL DB. I have also had Application Support roles where I have spent most of my time in SQL, querying data and carrying out data fixes.

At another role, one of our devs destroyed the test DB as they forgot to include ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"" on a script they were testing.

Finally managing Database clusters. Yeah this is a thing.

So where does an ORM fit into all of this, in a real world setting. Yeah its kind of nice in my simple app, defining a single table basically using OOP.

But I feel I am missing something vital."

Recently interviewed at NVIDIA for a Deep Learning Algorithm Engineer role as a junior developer and I didnt know fundamental computer architecture concepts like tensor parallelism, which after a bit of researching led me to C++ and cuda programming. How important are these concepts to know? Perhaps it was NVIDIA that is primaraly a HW company that wanted such deep understanding, but I feel these concepts are transferable to any ML Engineering job. Is it actually worth taking the time to learn C++ and these concepts? Also what kind of projects useful to learn and showcase to recruiters what you have learned? I have a basic understanding of C++ through university classes like OOP and Data Structures and a small project I built for a genetic algorithm so I am not that irrelevant but also not good enough to the point that I can say in my resume that I know C++. That would be an insult to someone that is actually knowledgable. I also feel like the AI world besides the LLM hype and the Langchain RAG stuff, has many opportunities in Robotics in which I dont know if one can get away without C++.

For reference (before you roast my lack of knowledge) I do all my work in Python with Pytorch which abstracts away anything to do with hardcore cuda programming. I consider myself quite proficient with these technologies (not perfect, but good enough for a junior I suppose). I had a 3 month internship, a contract with the same company for an additional 7 months (so around 10 months professionaly) and some personal projects with computer vision and diffusion models.

* Does the phrase ""schema migration"" only ever refer to migrating between database versions ? Or can I use it in other contexts as well ? E.g. if I'm changing the structure, property fields and public API methods of some core classes, can I refer to it as a ""class schema migration"" ?

1. **Forgetting what I've learned** \- I had a decent grasp of DSA and web development a few months ago, but now I'm blanking on concepts I used to know. It feels like everything is slipping away.
2. **Want to explore different areas of tech** \- I haven't really figured out what I want to specialize in yet. I want to try different fields (web dev, app dev, AI/ML, backend, DevOps, etc.) to see what clicks with me, but I don't know how to explore efficiently with limited time.
3. **Can't seem to start learning again** \- Even though I genuinely love tech, I haven't learned anything new in the past month. When I try to sit through tutorials now, it feels exhausting and I can't focus.
4. **Over-reliance on AI tools** \- I know this has contributed to not truly understanding concepts deeply.

**What I'm looking for:**

* **How to explore different tech domains efficiently?** With limited time, how do I get a taste of different fields without spending months on each?
* **How to retain knowledge when you have limited practice time?** Any techniques or strategies?
* **Resources for exploring different tech fields** (DSA, web dev, mobile dev, AI/ML, etc.) - practical ones that don't require hours of passive watching?

This isn't a question about code, or a self promotion, so if that is not allowed please let me know ASAP so I can promptly remove this post. This is however, a question to those curious minds wanting to understand and learn OpenGL. Or even just want to know how computer graphics works in general.

First, some context.

A while ago I undertook the arduous task of learning OpenGL. From all the basics of drawing primitives and up to advanced concepts such as compute shaders and volumetric cloud rendering. The entire process was an immense learning curve and honestly felt like I was relearning how to program. The result is a procedurally generated universe where you can explore endless galaxies and solar systems. However, it is still unfinished and I will continue working on it.

I found that while learning OpenGL you are bombarded with terminology, and it can be quite difficult to take these concepts and develop your own ideas. So, I was thinking of making a series that introduces you into the concepts needed, and develop an intuitive understanding of graphics programming. Then each concept we learn we can apply that to our custom program.

So my question is, would any of you be interested in this? Would you have any recommendations? Or should I scrap this idea? I already have a 'thumbnail' (not a very well thought out one) that I put together if anyone would like to see it. I will provide a link to a google docs if that is allowed. Once again, it is an unfinished project but I will continue to develop it and add new features as the series continues.

Once again, sorry if this is not the right subreddit to be posting to.

Thank you! :)"

However, when it comes to doing something for myself, I just can’t come up with anything.
I have this random  urge to try to code some pet-project or implement smth cool from time to time, but I just cant.
It is to the point where its just no coherent thought visits my brain, or even if I have something in mind I instantly throw it away, justifying it as hard/easy/time consuming to do.

I feel some sort of stagnation at this point, as the daily job becomes more and more mundane and I feel like I am stuck.

I get the basic ideas, but the generation code is so difficult to understand, as well as the shader code.

Even though I have some experience with Java making Minecraft mods, at Berklee we have only one intro to programming class that covers python, html, and Javascript, so I’m wondering if there were other math classes, programming classes I took how much easier would this be? How did Sebastian Lage manage to perfect his skills? To have this level of understanding and creativity is something I crave.

I used ChatGPT to try to understand each line of code but it feels like it’s taking way too long as my assignment is only due in a week, so I feel like I have to just vibe code without learning, which is frustrating — ending up with so much slop that your program breaks.

It’s a small real project, not just a tutorial: a backend service plus a CLI tool that talk to each other over HTTP.

My background is mostly in higher-level languages (Python / JS), so I’m comfortable with basic Go syntax, slices, maps, methods, etc. What I’m trying to avoid is just “writing Python in Go syntax”.

Right now I’m especially interested in:

1.	Project structure and modules: how you usually structure small to medium Go projects in terms of packages, internal vs public APIs, and Go modules. What’s a reasonable layout for something that might grow later but isn’t a huge monolith yet.

2.	Error handling and context: patterns you actually use in practice for returning errors, wrapping them, and when to use the context package properly instead of just passing it everywhere “because Go”.

3.	Concurrency: I understand goroutines and channels at a basic level, but I don’t want to sprinkle them everywhere just because they exist. In small services, when do you prefer simple goroutines, when do you reach for worker pools, and when do you avoid concurrency completely.

4.	Interfaces: I’ve read that Go interfaces are usually defined at the consumer side and kept small. Any concrete examples of when it makes sense to introduce an interface in a codebase, versus when it’s over-engineering coming from OOP habits.

I’m already using go fmt, go test and go vet, and reading the standard library docs, but I’d really appreciate advice from people who have written production Go: patterns that aged well over years, and “I wish I hadn’t done this” stories.

If you were starting Go today with some experience in other languages, how would you approach your first real project so that it ends up idiomatic and maintainable instead of just a translated mental model from another language."

I recently bought the Logitech MX Master 4, thinking it would be easy to use across all my computers. I previously used a Logitech vertical mouse, but I wanted to switch for the gestures.

Here’s the problem: I have multiple computers at home (a personal Mac, a Linux PC, and a Windows work machine). On the Windows PC, I was able to install Logi Options+ (v1.98.x) and customize the mouse without issues.

On my Mac (Monterey 12.7.6), I can only install Logi Options+ v1.93.x, which doesn’t support the MX Master 4 properly. I found that the app version needs to be ≥1.95.x. I even tried running a VM with a newer macOS version and installing v1.95.x, but the mouse still isn’t recognized. On my Windows work PC, v1.98.x works fine, so I guess I need this version.

I’m a data scientist and haven’t built apps that interact with hardware like this before. As a last resort, I’m thinking about creating my own “Logi Options+” to customize the mouse. I don’t mind voiding the warranty; I just want to get full functionality.

From my research, it looks like AppKit with Swift (on XCode) might be the right approach, but I’m struggling — probably because I’m used to scripting/data science workflows.

Has anyone here built a macOS app to interact with hardware like this? Could you point me in the right direction — what frameworks or approaches I should (or shouldn’t) use?

Thanks in advance!"

• Clean and intuitive UI
• Quick access to tasks, todos, bugs, and documentation
• Good tagging or categorization
• Easy to maintain as a single developer
• Ideally free or with a strong free tier

Tools I've tested or considered:
• **Notion**: Flexible, but chaos happens fast.
• **Obsidian**: Fast and markdown-based, but unclear if ideal for structured task management.
• **Trello**: Great for Kanban, but limited for deeper documentation.
• **Jira**: Probably overkill for solo devs, but maybe some of you like it?
• **Other free tools** that help maintain order without overwhelming me.

I'm also wondering if there are good templates specifically tailored for solo developers: project dashboards, roadmaps, bug tracking templates, etc.

My ""experience"" with DRY

I've been remaking an API to learn design patterns. And one of the things I've been going out of my way to avoid is abstracting the repositories. The reason behind that is, the first few versions of this API (Files are lost) I did exactly that, everything worked really well until I had to do major changes in one of them. And since everything was super tied together any change I did would require me to change the others or add new methods that will handle the new changes. I did find some work around at the time but they were not great and I ended up remaking the whole thing with out abstracting the repositories again.

One of my main problems at the time with DRY was adding logic to the try/catch block that was abstracted. That's why I'm searching for a solution that's is flexible enough to allow this.

The API isn't done, there are like 100 things to be added, that's why I've been hesitant of abstracting them.

I will be honest, the first few versions were bad, really really bad, horrible, the worst thing you will ever see (service logic mixed with repositories...) and I do believe that's part of it why I couldn't properly separate them. The current one isn't the best yet but it's a day and night difference from the older ones, I'm still learning on how to do things the right way, and that's why I'm posting this.

IDK why I was embarrassed about posting this."

In most systems I’ve seen, identity for these things grows “organically” over time: API keys here, service accounts there, a few mTLS certs, some long-lived tokens that nobody wants to rotate because nobody is 100% sure what they would break.

A mental model I’ve found useful is to separate three questions:

1.	⁠where does the identity actually originate (self-proven, attested by a platform, asserted by something I control),
2.	⁠what privileges it starts with at birth (zero, minimal baseline, or explicit rights), and
3.	⁠whether it is disposable or meant to be durable.

That model is nice on paper, but I’m curious about the ugly real world.

For people who have had to clean up or design these systems in production:
– How do you practically move from a “bag of secrets and service accounts” to something more coherent?
– Do you apply a model like this retroactively as a diagnostic tool, or only as a hard constraint for new services?
– Are there patterns that worked well for you whee unifying identity across different environments (Kubernetes, VMs, serverless, external SaaS APIs, etc.)?

As I worked my way through their distributed systems course, I found myself checking blog posts, Reddit, and using Claude to explain the concepts more clearly and succinctly. After a few days of this, I essentially stopped using the course altogether, and just used the outline as a primer for learning & quizzing myself inside of Claude.

Latin has a very interesting way of generating words: You have an word stem, which usually doesnt change, and then an very big number of possible suffixes that change based on the context in which the word appears.

For example, lets take the word ""Servus"", which means (a male) slave. (Dont be scared, its a unfortunately very common word in the roman time period, in which most of the training texts are settled).

In the nominative case, its just ""Servus"", while the genitive case has ""servi"", the dative has ""servo"" and the accusative case has ""servum"" (Cases determine the function of a Noun in the context of a sentence and therefore are extremly important for translations).

But then there are also the plural forms, which are ""Servi"", ""servorum"",""servis"" and ""servos"" respectively.

And nouns are a comparatively easy example here. Putting aside the fact that the suffixes also change based on the declension of a word (mostly affected by grammatical gender), Verbs have even more different attributes to them, especially when it comes to the tempus.

This requires me to somehow construct something that can handle a lot of those cases, the question is just, how.

My first instinct was creating a Noun-Class (Java) and then create a constructor that takes the word stem and the grammatical gender and then write methods that return the fitting suffix based on the context that is called.
This looks then like this:

    public String getNominativeSingular() {
        StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
        stringBuilder.append(stem);
        String suffix = """";
        switch (gender){
            case
    NEUTRUM
    -> {
                suffix = ""um"";
                break;
            }
            case
    MASCULINUM
    -> {
                suffix = ""us"";
                break;
            }
            case
    FEMININUM
    -> {
                suffix = ""a"";
                break;
            }
        }
        stringBuilder.append(suffix);
        return stringBuilder.toString();
    }

In a vacuum this approach is fine, but it feels like this might cause more work than actually necessary in the long run. Imagine this as a big table with multiple dimensions. What i could imagine would be creating a big Array with multiple dimensions that have a size based on the amount of states that the given properties can have. Does this sound like it makes sense or are there some patterns i potentially could utilise?"

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pfnajh/programmers_please_stop_making_instructional,Programmers please stop making instructional,"I'm trying to understand classes, but almost all the videos online just show you how to type them up, but almost none of them explain things, like how constructor calls work, or how data flows though the structure. Thanks to AI I'm unscrambling all this, and now I do understand the basics. One example is a video titled ""Everything you need to know about classes in 5 min"" The instructor is talking about methods and loops but makes no mention of that. Fix the darn title. This video is great for someone who understands classes, but just when you feel like you are starting to understand them, you're left lost again because most youtube videos (titled everything you need to know in 5 min) are examples on how to do things, but NO logic behind the structure and flow of data, and that goes for Udemy videos. Very frustrating for new learners. The title should be something else, not ""everything you need to know"". Because I obviously don't know everything or else I would not be confused. If you (the instructor) are not calling things by name, such as variables, function calls...ect or explaining the flow of data - then you are only speaking to advanced users who probably already know what you're showing them. Don't bother.

A class is automatically called or defined when you create a new instance. This same instructor wrote square = Polygon(4, ""square"") which is a constructor call. - It allocates memory for a new Polygon object. - It automatically calls the \_init\_ method with the arguments (4, ""square""). - The new object is returned and assigned to the variable square. My point is, If none of this logic is explained, then you are assuming the viewer knows everything about classes (in this example). At least use a title that reflects what you are teaching."
https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pfosr0/are_people_who_mainly_use_unityunreal_still,Are people who mainly use unityunreal still,"I was thinking about something I saw from Notch where he seemed to distinguish between ""real programmers"" and ""people who use development environments / game engines"".

What confuses me is this:

1) A ""normal"" programmer also relies on tons of libraries and frameworks.

2) Nobody really studies every single line of those libraries.

3) Yet we still call them programmers.

But then, when someone works mostly inside a game engine like Unity or Unreal, some people say ""that's not really programming anymore, you're just using an engine"".

So my questions are:

1. Where do you personally draw the line between ""programmer"" and ""someone who just uses tools""?

2. Is using Unity/Unreal as your main environment enough to NOT be considered a programmer?

3. Is there any meaningful difference between relying on libraries/frameworks in code vs relying on a game engine?

I'm not trying to start a fight about who is ""real"" or ""fake"", I'm just genuinely trying to understand how people in the industry think about this."

I graduated with a CS degree in 2021, but due to some life circumstances and a tough job market, I haven't held a developer position since then. I've decided to stop worrying about the gap and finally get back into the saddle to break my impostor syndrome.

My goal is to build a portfolio of 2–3 solid projects to prove (to myself and employers) that I can still write code. I’m looking for some feedback and/or suggestions on a learning path.

As it stands, I have familiarity with the following programming languages and will list my strength/capability with said languages:

Python: 8/10 - I can confidently write most things in Python and I think the only thing that I would need to re-visit are some OOP concepts and other small nuances given that most OOP I did during my undergraduate years were done in Java. I've tinkered with (but could never really finish or grasp) Pythonic frameworks like Flask and Django, and that's as far as I've ever went project-wise with the language. Can say without a doubt it's my strongest language. I have some books like *Fluent Python 2nd Edition, Django 4 By Example 4th Edition,* that I bought a year or so ago; was wondering if they're still relevant or have become outdated. What other books or resources would you recommend?

Java: 5/10 - It's been a *whileeeeeee* since I wrote anything in Java, but a lot of job descriptions I've seen for listings in my area have things like Java Spring and Spring Boot which have roots in the language, therefore piquing my interest to re-visiting Java. The problem? I can hardly remember the syntax let alone know if it's worth re-learning. Is it worth re-visiting Java just for the job market, or should I double down on Python to get ""job ready"" faster? If I do go the Java route, what is the best ""refresher"" resource for someone who already understands the theory but forgot the syntax?

C++: 5/10 - Roughly the same description as above, but will say it was my favorite to play around with and was a bit simpler to understand vs. Java. Was told there was still demand with the language, particularly in Finance and Embedded Systems.

... and other languages that I can say I have ""familiarity"" with, but have hardly done things in: C#, Bash, and JavaScript.

So I wanted to listen to some opinions who cracked this thing before me.

I took some time off from work and would like to dedicate it to solidifying knowledge in some technologies as well as learning others. I had an idea on how to go about it, but while talking with one colleague his words discouraged me from this initial idea.

So, one of us thinks that I should pick up a project, design it in broad terms, do some research on what technologies make sense for it, then learn them as I work on the project.

The other thinks that I should make a list of topics (design patterns etc) and technologies I would like to learn, find some solid resources, follow them. As I follow the concepts I also do exercises or make up examples to apply the knowledge / tinker with the different info. As knowledge accumulates, I revisit these exercises and see if there are better ways to do those things and why. By the time I have covered a significant amount of the material, I think of a project that would be fitting for the topics and technologies I am studying and work on it.

In case the answer to my question is ""whatever works for you"", I don't know what works for me. I have a couple of years of experience, but I always learn things as I go in a very half baked way. That has made me professionally insecure, because my knowledge does not match my hard work or years of experience.

My goals are, 3 months of studying. I should learn design patterns and architecture, solidify my python, airflow, spark and postgresql knowledge. Learn kafka and some kubernetes and aws services. In the end, definitely create at least one project (although I would prefer several smaller projects) that intertwine the different things I learned. Other studying (as well as living ..) I don't have any other commitments

A little backstory. 2nd Year SWE student, applied for an internship, got completely grilled in the interview.

The interviewer asked my about RAG based Chatbots and unit testing and everything. I tried to answer to the best of my ability. He asked me about my current project, i tried to answer faithfully.

But then he pointed something out, ""you seem the types who jump the gun"" You start building before even understanding what you want to build. You have no research methodology. You don't think about architecture and stuff. Requirements and everything. Bro grilled me.

I has stuck with me.

I wanna ask you guys, let say you had a idea for a project and you want to make it.

How do you research that project, like proper research?

What resources do you use, how do you use AI for it? How do you learn something that you need for the project?"

For those who don't know, GSoC is a program that connects new contributors with open-source organizations for a 3+ month mentorship. You get to work on a real-world project, learn from experienced mentors, and get paid for it! It's a great way to build your skills, get real-world experience, and become part of the open-source community.

The program has been running for over 20 years and has helped launch the careers of thousands of developers. The numbers are pretty impressive: over 22,000 contributors have been paired with more than 20,000 mentors from over 1,000 open source organizations.

This year, there's an expanded focus on projects in **AI, Security, and Machine Learning**, so if you're interested in those fields, it's an especially good time to apply.

The application period for contributors is from **March 16th to March 31st**.

You can read the full announcement on the Google Open Source Blog: [https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/12/shape-future-with-google-summer-of-code.html](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/12/shape-future-with-google-summer-of-code.html)

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pdefnr/computer_engineering_student_torn_between,Computer engineering student torn between,"Hi everyone. I’m currently in my 5th semester of Computer Engineering and I’m trying to figure out which path to follow professionally. Until recently I was leaning toward software development, but after reading a public-sector job exam syllabus from my city (it had a ton of infrastructure topics), I got really interested in infra/cloud and started considering security too.

The problem is: I feel kind of lost about where to start studying infrastructure properly. My initial idea was to use that exam syllabus as a structured study guide, then later go for cloud certs (AWS/Azure/GCP). But someone told me that using a government exam syllabus as a learning roadmap isn’t a great idea, and that infrastructure can be a tough field in terms of pay and quality of life early on (lots of on-call, lower salaries in some places, etc.).

They suggested a more “traditional base” first, like:

* strong Linux fundamentals (LPIC-1/2)
* Windows basics
* virtualization (VMware)
* storage fundamentals
* DB administration
* containers (Docker → Kubernetes later)
* IaC (Terraform)
* configuration management (Ansible)
* maybe CompTIA certs (A+, Network+, etc.)

They also said DevOps/DevSecOps usually come later in a career, after you’ve had solid experience in infra + dev (and security for DevSecOps).

On top of that, I’m planning long-term to work abroad. I have Italian citizenship and I’ve lived in Spain before, so Europe is a realistic option for me. My English is decent (not perfect yet, but improving). I’m also saving money monthly so I can move if needed. That said, if I found a good remote job paying in EUR/USD, I might even stay in Brazil.

So my questions are:

1. For someone still in college, does it make sense to start with infrastructure as a base and move into cloud later? Or is it better to go straight into cloud studies early on?
2. Between infrastructure/cloud and security, which one is smarter to focus on first if I genuinely like both? I’m thinking: build a strong infra foundation first, then if I end up enjoying security more, transition over time since they overlap a lot.
3. For people who’ve worked in Europe (or hired there): is it true that with 2–3 years of solid experience you can become competitive there pretty fast? What skills/certs/projects actually matter most for entry-level roles?
4. Since I’m still in university, would it be worth trying to transfer to a European university (Erasmus / full transfer / master later), or is it better to finish here and move with experience?

I’d really appreciate any advice, especially from people in infra/cloud/security or who’ve made a similar move abroad. Thanks!"

""They're still getting better and better. It's only a matter of time before they replace the need for developers altogether.""

I'm aware that these models are continually improving despite hallucinations. But the nature of predictive modelling means that they can still never be 100% certain.

""Sure, but a model that's 99.999% right is still better than a flawed human developer.""

Even [this paper ](https://openai.com/index/why-language-models-hallucinate/)from an OpenAI researcher acknowledges the fact that better models would not necessarily be the ones that reach 99.9999% certainty, but rather ones that can admit wrongness more often instead of confidently guessing. It even states that small-language models are better at knowing their limits. Bigger isn't always better.

""Most scoreboards prioritize and rank models based on accuracy, but errors are worse than abstentions. Our [Model Spec⁠(opens in a new window)](https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-02-12.html#express_uncertainty) states that it is better to indicate uncertainty or ask for clarification than provide confident information that may be incorrect.""

I tried to get around that by trying to make the art text smaller while keeping the conversational text large enough but a quick google search revealed that having such varying font sizes is not possible within a terminal.

Any ideas as to how to solve that issue?"

i took a drop year after 12th without really knowing what i’ll do, but after trying diff stuff i kinda stuck to learning computer science.

so far Ive done cs50, 6.100L (MIT python intro to computation nd progaming), and messed around with dev stuff through random youtube tutorials. got exposure to python, c, little bit of dsa theory + math (nothing solid), and from dev side html/css/js. couple days ago i followed [roadmap.sh](http://roadmap.sh) and read more about how internet, browsers, protocols work. so yeah nothing super strong but that’s what ive got right now.

right now i feel stuck between 2 paths:

**1) cs roadmap - grind leetcode for a month, then networking, computer architecture,  databases**
**2) full-stack roadmap - learn js properly, then some frontend + backend frameworks, then databases + devops**

last 2 weeks ive been doing 4 days development, 2 days core cs, sunday hobby stuff. sometimes it feels good, sometimes depressing cuz its been 4+ months and i don’t have lot of tangible results. and talking abt goals… i may not even be able to afford college next year so probably will need to get some job if college doesn’t happen. that also stresses me out.

so yeah i want to know which path should i go for and how do i even decide. any advice helps.

**TL;DR:**

took a drop year, learning cs, done cs50 + MIT intro + some dev basics. stuck between full cs path (leetcode + core subjects) vs full-stack roadmap. 4 months in, not seeing results, kinda stressed cuz might not afford college. need suggestions on which direction to choose."
https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pd6np2/what_should_beginners_focus_on_first_in_java,What should beginners focus on first in java,"# **What Should Beginners Focus On First in Java: Understanding the Basics or Best Practices?**

Hello Java enthusiasts,

I’m Hamza from Morocco, and I'm new to using Java. As I start my learning journey with Java, I've been thinking about two important questions that I’d love to get advice on:

1. **Is there a big difference between Java 17 and Java 21?**
2. **Should I focus on understanding how Java works ""under the hood"" or learning the best practices and methods to use it effectively?**

### **Java 17 vs Java 21: Which One Should a Beginner Use?**

First, let’s talk about the versions. Java 17 is an **LTS (Long Term Support)** release, meaning it will receive extended support from Oracle. This makes it a stable and reliable choice for learning, especially if you’re just starting out. On the other hand, **Java 21** introduces new features and performance improvements. For example, Java 21 includes **pattern matching** and **virtual threads**, which can simplify your code and improve performance.

As a beginner, I’m wondering whether it's worth starting with the latest version, Java 21, to familiarize myself with new features, or whether it’s better to go with Java 17 since it’s more stable and will have broader community support. What do you think is better for someone just starting out?

### **Should You Focus on ""How Java Works"" or ""How to Use Java""?**

Now, here's the bigger question: **Should you dive into how Java works under the hood, like understanding the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), memory management, and garbage collection**, or is it better to focus on **learning how to use Java efficiently with best practices**?

#### **Understanding Java Under the Hood:**

* **Pros**: You’ll gain a solid foundation in the language’s inner workings. You’ll learn about memory management, how the JVM executes your code, and how garbage collection works. This deep knowledge can help you write more efficient, optimized code and troubleshoot performance issues better.
* **Cons**: It can be overwhelming and may slow you down in the early stages of learning Java. Understanding how everything works is important, but it might be too much for a beginner who just wants to build projects.

#### **Focusing on Best Practices:**

* **Pros**: Focusing on best practices will help you become productive faster. You’ll learn to write clean, readable, and maintainable code, which is extremely valuable for your projects. You'll also learn about libraries, frameworks, and tools that make Java development easier.
* **Cons**: You might miss out on understanding some deeper concepts that could help you debug complex issues later on.

### **My Current Dilemma and What I’m Looking for:**

As a beginner, I’m currently leaning towards focusing on practical Java development—learning how to write functional and clean code, using the right methods and tools for projects, and gradually exploring advanced topics as needed. However, I’d love to hear from more experienced developers: **Is it more important to have a deeper understanding of how Java works internally from the start, or is it okay to focus more on learning best practices and working with Java as a tool?**

I’m open to hearing your thoughts, and any advice or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated!"

So far, I’ve built most of the layout system:

* Polygon, rectangle, and layer rendering on a canvas.
* A visual structure similar to InDesign frames.
* I can render static text inside a single frame.

However, I’m now stuck on implementing text layout and overflow detection that works like InDesign, where:

* Text automatically continues (flows) from one frame to another (linked frames in a “story”).
* The layout engine detects how much text fits inside a given frame (based on width, height, font metrics, leading, tracking, etc.).
* Any overflowing text automatically flows into the next linked frame.

I initially tried integrating Draft.js for rich text editing, but it’s clearly not suitable for this kind of layout/flow behavior especially since I’m rendering everything on the canvas, not in the DOM.

What I’m looking for guidance on:

* How InDesign or similar layout engines conceptually handle overflow detection and multi-frame text flow.
* Recommended approach or architecture to replicate this behavior in a custom canvas-based text layout engine.
* Any known algorithms, open-source projects, or research materials that explain how to implement text layout and pagination/flow logic similar to InDesign’s story XML model.

Technologies involved:

* JavaScript / TypeScript
* Canvas rendering (custom rendering engine)
* Custom polygon/rectangular text frames

I’m a QA engineer with 3 years of experience in both automation and manual testing at a project-based company. I’ve been thinking about expanding my career opportunities, so I decided to learn .NET development.
I completed a basic Udemy course and I’m currently working through a second one. So far, the material seems manageable and I feel like I’m understanding the concepts. However, when I open up a real project to look at as an example, it’s completely overwhelming - there are so many files, and I can’t make sense of how everything fits together. This makes me anxious and I start doubting myself, thinking maybe I’m not cut out for this, that it’s too difficult, or that it’s meant for people smarter than me.
On top of that, I rely heavily on AI assistance right now, and honestly, I feel like I wouldn’t be able to write much code without it.
I wanted to reach out and ask: are there any QA professionals here who successfully transitioned to development? If so, could you share some words of encouragement or advice? I’d really appreciate hearing about your experience.
Thanks in advance!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

On the other hand, I do 3 hours for front-end self study and I usually just follow FCC's Curriculum, I dont make any projects out of it, i mean I do, but only 1 or two mini projects, compared to C where I'd make 3 or more mini projects.

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pceges/where_should_i_start,Where should i start,"Hi everyone,
I posted here before saying that I’m a Software Engineering graduate who feels completely lost, and many people told me to either try getting an internship or start building small projects to figure out if I even enjoy programming. The problem is that during university I mostly studied just to pass exams, not to really learn, so even though I worked with front-end, Java, C++, and a few other things, I honestly forgot most of it because I never practiced. I also feel like there are a lot of basic concepts I should already know but don’t.

Another thing that’s been holding me back is applying to companies. Most places ask for a CV, and I honestly don’t feel confident putting mine out there. It’s not that the things I list are “wrong”—I really did study them—but I don’t master them and barely remember anything. That makes me hesitate to apply for internships or entry-level positions because I feel like I don’t truly deserve the skills I say I have.

At the same time, I always felt like things like HTML or even C++ are “easy” and that anyone can learn them, so I’m not sure if I should learn completely different languages like Java or Python, or if I should just stick to one clear track and build from there.

Right now I want to restart properly from zero, but I don’t know where to begin. I see a lot of people recommending The Odin Project—would that be a good starting point? I can study around 4–6 hours a day, but I don’t want to waste time on something too basic or something that won’t help me get anywhere. I’m also not sure whether to focus on front-end, back-end, or try both at the same time. And I’m confused about how people even start building small projects—do you follow certain websites for ideas, or specific courses?

What’s also discouraging me is AI. It feels like AI can now build a full website in minutes while a beginner needs days. Is this actually true, or am I overthinking it? Should I look into mobile development instead, or try something that fits the market better?

Any advice or a clear roadmap for restarting would really mean a lot. Thanks 🙏 ."

Could they be using the Figma Plugin API instead of REST API?

\- Plugins run inside Figma (might avoid rate limits)

\- Can access design data directly

\- Could send to external backend

**Questions:**

1. Do Figma plugins bypass REST API rate limits?
2. Is this the standard approach for production tools?
3. Any other strategies to handle scaling?

**Background:**

\- Figma changed limits in Nov 2024 (10-100/min by plan)

\- Can't request exceptions

\- Need to support multiple users

Any insights would be super helpful!"

I need some real talk from people who’ve been in the game for a minute.

I’ve been feeling this strong pull toward software engineering. I actually love coding and solving problems, especially when it comes from that inner “I’m doing this because I want to” energy.

I’m 21, working in marketing right now, but coding has been the thing that really makes me feel alive lately. I like building stuff that actually exists in the world, things that people can use, see, feel, you know?

I’m just scared it might be that random spark that dies out later lol. My brain works kinda wild, if something doesn’t hook me or challenge me enough, I get bored and jump to something new. But with code it feels different, like I want to dive deeper, but the fear still hits sometimes.

Have any of you ever felt that? The “is this real or just hype?” moment? How did you deal with it? Did that feeling go away with time or experiences? I’d appreciate any stories or advice, fr.

I’m learning everything from zero by myself, building projects, watching talks, reading docs, trying to absorb the real engineering mindset. And I really want to know if this path can match both freedom and a meaningful career for me.

I know this sounds weird but my situation is complicated, if I were to explain it this post would be way too long. I'm getting treatment for it and maybe I'll be able to resume college next academic year. I really wish I could just continue instead of wasting my time bc my coach is underestimating me but I need a decent alternative that doesn't cost me a fortune and maybe helps me get through college faster later on if possible. I just want that degree ASAP really.

I'm mainly interested in learning programming so I can have a career related to it later and can maybe develop an indie game or two in my off time, before I started with college I had basically zero programming experience, now I have a little but it's not enough really. I thought ""I'll just go through college and when I have my degree I'll be all set""

I learned from boot.dev from a few sponsorships and bought a subscription once but I barely felt like using it bc the opinions on it were mixed and I refunded it. Now there's a pretty good deal for it from Black Friday. I often have trouble with motivating myself to study and getting enjoyment out of it so maybe this helps. Seems like a good fit for an introvert like me I guess? It says you can get hired after 12 or so months of using it but is that actually legit or is it just false advertising? I've also heard mixed opinions about whether the certificates you can get from it, or from anywhere really, are actually useful, or whether employers actually care for them. I know getting a degree is important and I want to get one at some point, this is just an alternative to pass the time until next academic year while I'm getting treatment. I'm not sure if this will actually shorten the time I have to wait before I can get that degree tho.

Has anyone here actually taken courses from boot.dev and what are your opinions on it? Were the certificates actually useful? How long will it take me to go through it if I try to use it as a substitue for college and spend like say 40 hrs a week on it? So is this actually useful enough to me or should I go argue with my study coach?

EDIT: Just wanted to point out that while I do want to make indie games, I know I most likely won't be able to do it for a living so I do want to get a career that's adjacent to something like that and put programming experience and other CS-related things to use. I'm also consdering university instead of college but idk if that'll actually work better for me. So I guess boot.dev isn't a great way to self study?"

I have a degree in business administration and I recently finished a full-stack course. While doing this course I realized that I like the backend side more (creating the database, CRUD operations, SQL/Prisma, etc.). This made me think about possibly doing a master’s degree in data science to strengthen my knowledge.

However, looking at some universities that offer it, all of them emphasize on Excel and Power BI, and even require them as prerequisites. This makes me think that the program is aimed more at the data presentation and decision-making role within a company, and not so much at what I like and what I did in projects, which was creating tables and CRUD operations.

I’d like to know your opinion on whether a master’s in data science is a good way to gain knowledge to work in backend development, or whether there are better options.

I should add that I learned JS, and the courses I’ve seen use Python. They also include algebra, statistics, and other subjects.

I wanted to study a career that I both enjoyed and could get good money from, so I decided to go for Systems Engineering (in a University that focuses on Software Development and ICT).

At first it was really fun, I learned pseudocode and at the end of the semester I made an over 2000 line program that contained 10 minigames, each one more complex than the other. Everything was fine, until I got to the second semester and started learning basic programming. I found out they focused only on teaching java, and in the future we'll learn other languages like C++ and CSS, and while I stayed on track for most of the time, everything collapsed when we got to OPP and GUIs. Our teacher only taught us the basics, and said we had to learn the rest by ourselves. I couldn't find the time to do it because of homework from other subjects, and even when I did, I forgot everything faster than usual. Then he taught us UML diagrams, and same story, even when I watched a lot of tutorials, I could never understand how to do it properly.

My grades dropped a lot at this point, we had to construct small business applications that stored data on arraylists. I always got stuck at points where I tried to compile but got errors everywhere, and from that moment on, even if I wanted to learn so hard I just couldn't get myself to do it. Programming now feels overwhelming and boring, even if I get excited when thinking of project ideas, everything starts to feel too big for me at some point, and I drop it.

I'm really nervous because my final exam will be tomorrow and I have no idea how things will turn out for me, and after that I'll be on vacation.

Because I wanna get to that level and have the drive to do so but not the direction or the patience.

I have a ton of motivation and everyday I wake up and try to understand the concepts in OOP (also my next assessment for another topic is due soon which is data structures and algorithms and I’m quite behind because I’ve been focused on this).

This just feels like a lost cause I feel like throwing the towel in, I get it’s hard and it’s only going to get harder that’s the point.

Decided to go back to school to get my BS in Software Engineering and should be graduating in May (PERFECT timing). I have very little tech experience besides having done freelance work as a Lead QA Tester for an indie game published by Netflix and some volunteer QA testing for a couple other games.

I'm behind on applying to summer internships because I wanted my project to be in a better place but now I'm just pushing to get the MVP out asap so I have something to talk about.

My project is a recipe management and cost tracking web app that I thought of when I was a bread baker before going to school, I just didn't know how to build it then. But now I'm working with the bakery I worked at to develop this tool that they can use and we're all pretty excited about it. They (like every restaurant I've worked at) have all their paper recipes in messy, chaotic binders. So the core problem to solve was just digitizing and backing up all of their recipes in a way that is easy to access for everyone and easy to calculate batch quantities. That's the MVP. Beyond that though, I want to use the database design to implement cost tracking measures so that for example, if the price of eggs goes up overnight, they can instantly see how much that is going to affect the cost of every recipe that uses eggs. There's other things to add too like commenting on recipes, recipe versioning, search filters so the FOH people can easily look up allergens, etc.

I'm pretending to be the project manager on this as well so I have all the appropriate documentation like the Project Charter, PRD, technical documentation to navigate my frontend and backend code and I'm using a kanban board to keep track of tasks. I'm working with a UX designer/illustrator who also needs portfolio work and this will not only make the app nicer to use but it will show that I can work on a team.

The tech stack I'm using is Spring Boot (Java), Angular (TypeScript) and PostgreSQL (Supabase) and AWS. I'm using this mostly because that's what my school teaches but also hoping that the job market for Spring Boot and Angular is possibly a little less saturated than the MEAN stack that all the boot camps taught. Could be wishful thinking, but I actually enjoy the opinionated nature of Java and Angular even if progress is slower.

As soon as this app is ready enough to show off I'm going to start applying like crazy while I grind Leetcode and chip away at my school courses. I also have a couple small Godot game projects that I could polish up and add to my GitHub.

I'm learning Python from freeCodeCamp's and Harvard's CS50 Python course. I want to finish it, start doing some quizzes and tests and puzzles to apply what I learnt and keep it intuitive, however, it's important for me to learn how to organize my code, and keep it as conventional as possible, and knowing how to find the shortest cut to achieving a goal, how do I do that?

Is it just a skill that comes with learning? Are there tutorials that genuinely just teach keeping code organized and concise? Maybe courses about the conventions of Python and other languages to stay in order? I want to learn all that early on as I develop my skills to make it a habit, muscle memory to not struggle with it later on.

Thank you very much."

It worked perfectly fine on Windows 10, but it does not work on Windows 11. It even works fine on Linux using Proton.

I also noticed that on Windows 11, a minimized window is not “alive.” When I hover my mouse over its window on the taskbar, the application appears unresponsive.

When I maximize the window and keep it open, SendMessage works and the window receives the keystrokes normally. So it seems the problem is that Windows 11 leaves minimized windows “dead,” preventing them from receiving any input.

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1paixj7/rest_api_design,Rest api design,"Hey,
I’ve been building my REST API and recently stumbled upon a design problem. I’m working on an app for managing a car repair shop. I currently have a few routes, such as:

* `/api/clients`
* `/api/cars`
* `/api/car`
* `/api/jobs-histories` (where we store each car’s repair history)

Recently, my frontend developer asked me to create an endpoint that would allow him to **send a client and a car in a single request**, and also to **fetch a client and their car in a single request**. Now I’m wondering how to handle this in a RESTful way.

I’ve considered several options, but none of them seem ideal:

1. Allow passing a car object to the `/clients` route so that both objects are created together. But this feels wrong because the operation is supposed to create only a client, not a client and a car.
2. Introduce a new route like `/api/registration`. But the name feels misleading, and creating a new representation for every such scenario seems odd.
3. Add some kind of action endpoint like `/api/client/with-car`, but this looks like an anti-pattern since verbs should not appear in REST endpoints.
4. Create a generic actions/transactions endpoint like `/api/actions` or `/api/transactions` and put things like `/api/actions/client-with-car` under it. But this also feels like an anti-pattern.

Do you have any tips on which approach I should take? What is the correct way to solve this in a RESTful manner?

UPDATE:

Hey guys, I think I’ve found a way to address this. Thanks for all the answers.

The frontend needed this additional query mostly for convenience and to reduce latency in the app plus to make operation easier for frontend. After thinking about it, I realized that the first solution isn’t as bad as I initially thought. It’s actually quite reasonable: the **Client** is an aggregate root and it owns the **Car**, so creating both in a single request is acceptable(car as optional param)

I can also later support an `include` query parameter that allows the caller to decide whether they want the client returned with the car or not. This makes the route much more flexible and makes the entire API more expressive, because we’re not creating artificial endpoints for every possible data representation.

I think that API should describe **business entities**, not implementation details (like different representations of the same thing). So I’ll go with the first solution.

Thanks for all the answers!"

I would like some feedback on my work if possible.

For a little context, I decided to do a 3-reel game in C#. I generaterate a random number between 1 and 116 and print out a line from my reel set files corresponding to that number (I have 3 files each for one reel set and there's one symbol/emoji on each line). Then I compare the emojis printed out to see if it's a match

My biggest concern is that for every 100 spins, I win 1-2 times. Is it too low? I fear it is, do I fix it by editing my reel sets?

As for my reel sets, my approach isn't traditional (from what I've seen). I decided not to include empty/blank spaces on my reel sets, I rather just made a 116 rows long reel sets with symbols on each row.

I have decided to stick with learning Python after looking at a few other languages and their ecosystems.

I think I have made up my mind, but I still wanted to get your opinion, if my reasoning actually makes sense?

I get that languages dont matter much and it depends on your goals. My goal is basically to get a job or at least get my foot in the door ASAP.

At first I went with C++ because I thought it is low level, it will teach me the do’s and don’ts of programming. But then I asked myself, if I were a recruiter, would I hire a few-months-self-taught C++ dev? And honestly, no. C++ jobs usually expect way more than just the language. They tend to go really deep into CS and systems stuff.

So I switched to JS and Go. Go kind of felt like it had the same problem as C++ in terms of expectations, and JS is mostly web dev. Web dev is good for breaking into the industry, but nothing about web dev excited me(probably because I don’t understand it enough yet to appreciate it).

So now I am on Python high level, used in a ton of areas, kind of a jack of all trades language. It doesn’t seem to require the same hardcore CS fundamentals as low level roles, and it feels easier to break into and maybe even do small side gigs with.

And yeah, I know my explanation shows that I honestly don’t know what I’m really getting into. Every beginner asks the “which language should I learn?” question and gets the same(good) answer, but the fear of making a wrong choice still sticks around. Especially with all the talk about AI and the job market… it just amplifies that anxiety.

Anyways, pray for me. And I thank you for sharing your valuable insights.

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p9uf6a/best_stack_for_personal_project,Best stack for personal project,"I’m more of a beginner who’s just starting to learn to code, using AI coding assistants (Cursor, Copilot, etc.) as “training wheels” while I learn fundamentals along the way. In February I’ll start studying at a university where I’ll be surrounded by people who really know software engineering and are happy to help me, so I’ll have good support in real life as well.

I have a big long-term project in mind and I’d love your advice on the best technical foundation so I don’t have to switch stacks later.

What I want to build
I want to create my own “personal operating system” for ultra high performance, with:

A fully custom calendar (not Google Calendar) where I can plan my days, weeks, and months.

Project and task management (similar to a mix of Notion / Asana) with goals, priorities, and deadlines.

Meditation module with different practices and routines that I can schedule, track, and reflect on.

Fitness and sleep integrations using APIs like WHOOP and Oura to pull in data on recovery, strain, sleep quality, etc.

A system for goal setting, tracking, and reflection (short-, mid-, and long-term goals).

An AI “specialist agent team” for different domains (energy management, focus, planning, reflection, learning, etc.).

A main AI “orchestrator” that:

Has access to my data (calendar, tasks, biometrics, notes, habits, etc.).

Tracks my patterns over time.

Gives me suggestions on how to structure my days/weeks, improve performance, and recover better.

Dashboards that combine:

My current energy / recovery state.

Upcoming tasks and projects.

Sleep and training history.

AI-generated insights and recommendations.

On top of that, I have a strong interest in beliefs, mindset, identity, and habits of highly successful people. I want a feature where I can:

Store detailed notes about successful people (beliefs, identity, habits, principles, etc.).

Have these notes automatically processed into a meta-dashboard that shows common patterns across many people (like an evolving “success blueprint” for myself).

Store lots of notes in a flexible way (somewhat Notion-like), with tagging, search, and later analysis by AI.

Design requirements
Design is very important to me:

It should look and feel premium, very smooth and beautiful.

I want full theming, especially light, dark, and maybe a “galaxy / universe” style theme (I like the look of tools like Comet).

I care a lot about micro-interactions, animations, and the general “feel” of the app, not just functionality.

Other notes:

I don’t want to constantly change programming languages later if I can avoid it. I know migrations are possible, but I’d like to pick a stack that can scale with me from “learning projects” to something potentially serious.

I’m okay with starting web-first (desktop browser), and maybe adding mobile later once the core works.

Of course I am sure I will have more ideas on what to add in the future so I want the possibility to do so and not be limited by my stack.

What I’m currently thinking
Right now, I’m leaning towards:

Frontend: React (with something like Tailwind + a modern UI library such as shadcn/ui / MUI / similar for beautiful, customizable components and theming).

Backend: Node.js with Express (or maybe NestJS later) for APIs.

Database / backend-as-a-service: something like Supabase or Firebase for auth, database, and possibly real-time features.

AI layer: calling external APIs (OpenAI / Claude etc.), possibly adding a separate Python microservice later for heavier analysis / agents if needed.

My questions to you:

What do you think about React + Node.js as the core stack for this kind of project, given that I’m a beginner but will use AI coding assistance and have access to knowledgeable students at university?

Are there any major reasons I should consider a different stack (for example, Python + Django, Next.js fullstack, something else) for this type of long-term personal system?

From a long-term perspective (maybe turning this into a real product if it gets good), is React + Node + Postgres a solid foundation, or would you pick something else today?

Thank you for any advice, architecture ideas, or “don’t do this, you’ll regret it later” warnings."

to elaborate:

I have a reward graph that plots rewards in 15000 episodes:

    sum_rewards = np.zeros(episodes)
        for t in range(episodes):
            sum_rewards[t] = np.sum(rewards_per_episode[max(0, t-100):(t+1)])

            print(print_success_rate(rewards_per_episode))

        if is_training:
            f = open(""frozen_lake8x8.pkl"",""wb"")
            pickle.dump(q, f)
            f.close()

     

with parameters:

learning\_rate\_a = 0.9
discount\_factor\_g = 0.9
epsilon = 1        
epsilon\_decay\_rate = 0.0001  
rng = np.random.default\_rng()

as well as the main loop:

    for i in range(episodes):
            state = env.reset()[0]  # states: 0 to 63, 0=top left corner,63=bottom right corner
            terminated = False      # True when fall in hole or reached goal
            truncated = False       # True when actions > 200

            while(not terminated and not truncated):
                if is_training and rng.random() < epsilon:
                    action = env.action_space.sample() # actions: 0=left,1=down,2=right,3=up
                else:
                    action = np.argmax(q[state,:])

                new_state,reward,terminated,truncated,_ = env.step(action)

                if is_training:
                    q[state,action] = q[state,action] + learning_rate_a * (
                        reward + discount_factor_g * np.max(q[new_state,:]) - q[state,action]
                    )

                state = new_state

            epsilon = max(epsilon - epsilon_decay_rate, 0.0005)

            if(epsilon==0):
                learning_rate_a = 0.0001

            if reward == 1:
                rewards_per_episode[i] = 1

        env.close()

and the resulting graph shows that after hitting min\_eps at episode 10000, it starts rising and oscilating at the range between 20 to 40, and at about 14000 episode it rises again to a peak of 70% but starts to oscialte again before ending at 15000

I have no idea how to efficiently tune these parameters for the rewards to be more consistent and higher performance, please give me some suggestions, thank you"

For context: I am gearing up to spend the next 18-24 months to prepare myself to transition to a career in tech coming from an unrelated work and academic background. I’ve been fascinated with programming and software since I was a kid but let myself get discouraged and pursued “easier” paths. I’ve finally moved past that and want to do what I am passionate about. I am particularly interested in the backend and  ML, which is why I am starting with Python. I do best with active learning (kind of wax-on/wax-off) vs. lectures and reading, but these textbooks are great bc they are easy reads with lots of practice problems.

Where I am a little lost is how to intersect these resources for the best possible learning experience. It seems like PCC > Automate is a good pipeline to get a grasp of Python, but then FCC is a great place to begin working on projects and expanding my coding stack. Not sure if there is any truth to this, so any feedback is much appreciated. I have created a sort of syllabus to work through PCC and Automate with some projects in between learning phases, but would love to understand how to work FCC into this.

I checked out the FAQ and tons of other guidance in YouTube, but haven’t really found anything intersecting these resources. Any and all feedback is much appreciated, thanks!"

* Route-driven date changes
* Event bus + Redux
* Multiple hooks pulling data from different layers
* Window logic that constantly re-centers based on visibleMonth

It technically works, but it’s getting unstable: SQL locks, repeated queries, render loops, and UI delays. Fixing one issue often creates another because there are so many interconnected parts.

I’m starting to feel like this might be over-engineered.
Do people normally build calendar/task systems this way? Or is there a much simpler approach?

Would it make more sense to load tasks into memory and let the calendar filter locally, and use SQLite/Firestore just for persistence and sync? Is the rolling-window model even worth it?

I’m a junior software developer and lately I’ve been feeling really lost and frustrated. I keep making mistakes that, to me at least, feel *so logical* at the time. Sometimes I even check in code with comments in Git that, in hindsight, are clearly wrong.

When I get an assignment, I try to tackle it, but I often end up stuck. After finally figuring it out (usually with loads of help), I feel mad at myself because the solution ends up being “so easy” once you see it. This makes me question whether I’m actually a valuable addition to the team.

I know I’m learning, and I know mistakes are part of the process—but it’s hard not to feel like I’m constantly failing, even when I put in a lot of effort. I feel like im not even able anymore to solve problems. When I get a assignment im scared to just try it and play around because I dont wanna see stupid or I dont wanna add stupid things to the codebase (even tho its a feature branch)

Most of the extra time was from me struggling in the live coding part before eventually figuring things out.

They helped me, gave feedback about focusing on logic over syntax, and mentioned there’s one final interview if I advance.

How would interviewers interpret this? Is running long because of difficulty usually bad, or is recovery more important?

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p9kshf/can_a_bca_student_from_commerce_background,Can a bca student from commerce background,"Hey everyone,
I’m a commerce student thinking of pursuing a BCA because I want to become a data analyst. I also plan to study DSA alongside.

The only thing worrying me is that I don’t have a maths background and pure mathematics honestly scares me a bit. I’m not sure if that will become a barrier later when I study data-related subjects.

A lot of people keep telling me that BCA alone won’t get me anywhere and that I’ll face a lot of competition from B.Tech or BSc IT students. I do understand that skills matter the most, but I’m still scared that my stream or degree might hold me back.

So my question is:
Is it really possible to build a strong career in data analytics purely based on skills + a BCA degree from a tier-2 college?
Would love to hear from people who have been in a similar situation or are already working in this field."

I need some advice because I really don’t know how to move forward. I was comfortable at my programming skills before. I knew Java, Python, C#, and JavaScript and even frameworks such as Django, Spring, Vue, and WPF.

I stopped programming after I dropped out of school. Let’s just say a mix of pressure, financial difficulties, and mental health problems.

Now, every time I try to go back to programming and even just building simple console apps I get scared, nervous, and overwhelmed. I don’t know why. I feel like my knowledge of all the languages and frameworks that I learned had vanished (maybe it did?).

I just stare at a blank project in VS Code, frozen, and don’t know what to do. I tried watching programming tutorials again to refresh my knowledge on a language but I find it boring and I can barely focus.

I also tried a different approach. I tried creating a project instead of watching a youtube tutorial. But it’s the same.

This has been going on for about 2 years now. I honestly don’t know what to do. Hoping some of you can give an advice as to what I do.

I want to learn programming really. I can still see the same vision on my head about creating cool and helpful projects that help people.

Works on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Ideally can be written in C or JavaScript (Node.js).

Bonus points if it can:
Run locally without needing a full server setup.
I was thinking of maybe using Node.js with node-cron and nodemailer/twilio, or C with some kind of system scheduler and curl to send the message. But I’m not sure what the best approach is for something that works cross-platform and reliably.

Has anyone done something like this or have suggestions on the best way to implement it?

Looking for:
Code snippets or library recommendations.
Suggestions on scheduling and sending messages.
Any pitfalls I should avoid.

Based on your experience, what should I focus on next?
I don’t feel like I need a long list of things to accomplish. The problem is more that I feel overwhelmed by the sheer variety of choices I have from the point I stand right now.

Should I stick with Python and learn how to build applications? What about other languages?
Should I learn other programming languages? What about enhancing my portfolio?
Should I focus on enhancing my portfolio with my own projects? What about learning  how programming works at a higher level - how large systems work, how people collaborate in that scale, how software is handed?

I feel like I only do these things to like “pass” the course and then move on, i was in a pretty bad spot when I took data structures and can barely remember anything.

I’m scared that I won’t be able to fit into the profession and become a failure. I feel lost and don’t know if I should keep going, I honestly enjoy coding, but I can’t seem to grasp Data Structures or Big O at all. I live in Costa Rica and most job opportunities are outside of my country, my English is nearly perfect, but I know I’ll need more than what I’ve got right now to secure a stable, maybe even good-paying job.

I’m about to take my final exams for my last semester, and honestly… I feel like I learned nothing this year. We did databases, OS, Python, C — but none of it feels like it actually stayed in my brain. I love learning new things, but when it comes to applying them in real work, I’m pretty terrible.

Before this, I worked full-time doing photo editing and product upload stuff. My actual skills were fine, but I was \*slow\*, and I got yelled at a lot because of it. And being slow is basically a crime in real jobs. So now I’m worried — if I struggled with that, how am I supposed to survive in IT, where deadlines are everything?

So yeah. I’m low-key scared I might just be bad at programming.

During winter break (3 months), I’m planning to self-study like crazy to catch up. Stuff like:

\- reviewing C (loops, ifs, pointers, arrays — basically everything I should already know but don’t 😭)

\- rewriting C logic in Python to understand better

\- studying English

\- using AI tools to learn more

\- and drawing again, because I used to draw before getting into design

I checked my old drawings recently and realized I’ve never finished a single one — everything is just rough sketches I abandoned. So my goal is simply: finish one drawing. Doesn’t matter if it’s good. Just finish something for once.

If I still have time, I want to build small personal projects.
Like maybe a simple random item drop generator for a game or something.
If anyone has ideas for super beginner-friendly projects that only use loops + if-statements, I’d really appreciate it.👏

Also… for the self-taught programmers out there:
How did you actually learn?
What worked? What didn’t? How did you stay consistent when you felt like you sucked at everything?😶

Seriously.

In the old days you could build a career in a company and the company had loyalty to you, if you worked overtime you could work your way up the ranks

These days companies have zero loyalty to you and they are all, desperately praying and paying, for the day AI let's them slash the head count.

Old Fart's like me burned ourselves out and wrecked marriages and home life desperately trying to get technical innovations we knew were important, but the bean counters couldn't even begin to understand and weren't interested in trying.

We'd work nights and weekends to get it done.

We all struggle like mad to drop a puzzle and chew at it like a dog on a bone, unable to sleep until we have solved it.

Don't do that.

Clock off exactly on time, and if you need a mental challenge, work on a personal side hustle after hours.

We're all atrociously Bad at the sales end of things, but online has made it possible to sell without being reducing our souls to slimy used car salesmen.

Challenge your self to sell something, anything.

Even if you only make a single cent in your first sale, you can ramp it up as you and your hustles get better.

The bean counters are, ahh, counting on AI to get rid of you.... (I believe they are seriously deluded.... but it will take a good few years for them to work that out...)

But don't fear AI, you know what AI is, what it's real value is and how to use it better than they ever will.

Use AI as a booster to make your side hustles viable sooner."

In short, one of the things that told me was that modern CPUs are more capable when handling *floats* rather than *shorts* and even if it sounds couterintuitive its almost always faster to use floats.
This doesn't make sense to me since i've been learning that in order to optimize CPU's memory cache is best to use the lightest data types you can.

I did some simple scripts for personal use before, mostly batch and PowerShell, sometimes in Python. Also, I did some courses on Udemy and such, so at least I know what OOP is, for example.

Now, I'd want to write a specific app (flashcards) in C#. So, lets say I start with some C# tutorials, then start writing my app from basic to more advanced features, learning along the way. Is it going to teach me at least most common concepts in programming?
I remember trying C61a course from Berkeley and I think I wouldn't stumble upon most things by myself.

Being a beginning programmer, should I rather start with something more concept oriented (like the C61a)? Or try making that app searching for stuff along the way and then supplement it with a course on CS/programming with exercises?"
https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p8zebk/bootdev_worth_spending_money_on_for_the,Bootdev worth spending money on for the,"I tried boot.dev out for a bit earlier but didn't really feel like I should be spending time on this instead of studying CS at a college or university. I really wanted to make progress in college or university this academic year but I can't because of mental health issues. I can function okay-ish on my own but I run into trouble when I'm in a group which is something I have to deal with often in college. I'm currently in the process of being treated for this tho. I'm not really experienced with programming atm but I did a bunch of stuff in my first year of college so I'm not completely new to it.

I do want to just get a degree eventually so I'm wondering if doing something like boot.dev while waiting for the next academic year and for my treatment is gonna be worth the time and money investment. I heard that you can just do all of the courses for free but you won't get the solutions or the interactive features without a subscription. You won't get certificates without a subscription either. If I pay for boot.dev the main reason will probably be getting certificates on my resume. Not like I have anything else worth putting on my resume other than my high school diploma atm. Chances are employers will just throw my resume in the trash if they don't see a degree on it tho. I really just want that degree both for better chances in the future and for personal reasons tho.

I thought I could just get a college or university degree and be done with studying. Studying is not something I particularily enjoy, it can stress me out and take a lot of energy out of me and I often have to push myself to actually get motivated but if there's one thing I'm actually interested in it's the computer world. I wanted to go to college or university just so I could have a concrete plan and schedule and deadlines and exams and projects that I can earn college credit with. I have more trouble gathering the motivation for something else like boot.dev. If I can't get college credit for it I barely see the point. Maaaayybe I could get exemptions in college if I did something smiliar in boot.dev but I doubt it's possible. For university it definitely isn't. The boot.dev site does say you can get hired after doing their courses tho.

My end goal is to develop my own indie game, I at least want to be able to program it and make my ideas and concepts into reality, I'll worry about good visuals and sound when I'm confident enough I can actually make it happen. (I do not want to use AI for this) I estimate it's very unlikely this will actually make a profit or be a viable replacement for a full-time career in my case so this is mostly for my off time while I get a proper career that is related to programming or CS to get by.

If you were in my shoes would you buy 1 year of Boot.dev subscription or not? it's €124 for 1 year rn, not sure if I'll be able to complete the entire thing but I'll try. It really depends on how much I gain out of it. I'd really rather be in college rn so I'll mostly do this for the certificates. I'm twice-exceptional (autism and gifted) btw."

Anyway, for personal interest I have started this course and at the same time i began university (computer science, i am 35 now), and i’m finding it extremely difficult. in particular , drawing the circuit is not an easy task at all, you have to know boolean algebra pretty well, and manipulate boolean expressions, or use karnaugh maps. all things that are not explained in the course and you have to learn yourself and takes quite a lot of time. writing hdl is trivial, but those damn circuits.… i read old posts where people were able to complete this in no time, while i struggled a lot just to do the first module and I had to look up for the solutions of many circuits. i am kinda depressed. i think my problem was i was looking for some easy procedure or algorithm to solve the implementations, but there is not since this is a NP problem. the procedure i follow is usually to start from the truth table and then using the Disjunctive Normal Form. Of course this is not needed for AND, NOT and OR but still these basic three where not trivial either for me . Anyway, this is just a rant. I am kinda liking the course so far, but I wouldn‘t probably recommend it to beginners even if one doesn't need to know code, it is still very challenging, probably more than a basic code course"

I learn best by doing, and by doing something that's useful or valuable to me. So I decided that I want to build a program that can function as a way for me to keep track of my progress in Hollow Knight: Silksong.

I'm thinking these features (that I can come up with right now):
1) Obviously, tracking. So I can manually tick off when I've unlocked this and this thing.
2) A way to store information about where the thing, boss or similar is found.
3) For bosses, the option to add notes (on strategy or moves or whatnot). Maybe even a counter where I can put in how many times I died to it.
4) I want the opportunity to make it look visually pleasing. Icons from the game, banners, colors, etc.
5) Percentage overviews for each section (e.g. bosses completed, red tools unlocked, etc)

Inspiration example: https://th3r3dfox.github.io/silksong-tracker/

The application connects to an SFTP server, downloads a daily file, processes it, inserts/queries MySQL, then exits.

On certain days, the application crashes immediately after the SFTP session closes.

Running the app normally gives:

    free(): double free detected in tcache 2

**GDB Stack Trace**

I ran the program inside gdb to capture the crash point:

    #0  free()
    #1  mysql_free_result() from libmysqlclient.so
    #2  FMySql::FreeResult()
    #3  DB_GetAAAction()
    #4  FTPInDownload()
    #5  ProcessFTPDownload()
    #6  FTPIn()
    #7  main()

This suggests the application is freeing the same MySQL result multiple times.

**Valgrind Results**

Then I ran:

    valgrind ./AppName 2> valgrind_result.txt

Valgrind reports:

* “Invalid free / double free”
* Occurs during cleanup of MySQL result sets
* Happens after certain data is processed

Valgrind confirms that memory is being freed twice or corrupted before free.

**What I suspect**

Based on both GDB and Valgrind:

* There's some bug from ex dev (maybe time bomb)?
* There’s a memory management bug in the application code
* Specifically in the MySQL result cleanup path (mysql\_free\_result())
* Likely triggered by certain data conditions (larger file, different number of DB rows, empty result, etc.)
* Not caused by OS, MySQL server, filesystem, or environment
* Need to make new application with new setup?

I think the code path ends up calling mysql\_free\_result() twice on the same pointer during certain logic branches.

**Environment**

* RHEL 8.0
* MySQL client library (libmysqlclient.so.21)
* Custom in-house application (C++)
* SFTP → data parse → DB work → cleanup → crash

**What I need from the community**

* Does the stack trace + valgrind output point clearly to a double-free bug in the app, not MySQL?
* Could file size or data content realistically trigger a different code path that leads to double free?

**For developers:**

* Best practices to avoid double-free when using mysql\_free\_result()?
* Should result pointers always be nulled after free?

**For sysadmins/devops:**

* Is there anything I should double-check on the system side before pushing this to developers?

I have escalate this to both devops and head ICT.

They did not believe my findings,

and when they see I GDB,

they nuke me that's not the right tool to check."

Or does Selenium have some built-in mechanism for running tests in parallel across browsers and OS configurations?

I'm gonna start off by saying i know nothing about coding in the slightest and thats the reason I'm here. (i promise this is about coding, i just wanna give some context first)

In the last few years I've been traveling a lot by train through Europe, which have heightened my love for transportation by train. Almost everything about train rides is appealling, from the view to the calm nature of it. But there is one thing that i just can't stand about trains in Europe. It is a nightmare figuring out where to buy tickets because you need to buy them through a million different websites, and on top of that, having an overview of your planned trips and when they depart and arrive is close to impossible. So for the longest time i have been wanting to develop a site that does all that together, so traveling by train is easier to digest for people like me who also love it.

(here comes coding part)
So i have created a website with an AI website builder (sorry i know) to create the aesthetics around my site. It has the foundation for all the functions i want my site to have, but for the site to work, i need real-time API data and GTFS data to my site to function. I have tried for days (i know that it isn't that long and coding takes way longer to learn) to just learn the basics of how i could do that but i haven't gotten anywhere. I really want this to work and i haven't got the money to pay someone 50usd an hour to do a job that supposedly will take weeks. So am i stuck here? Do i need to learn to code it myself if i can't afford paying thousands of dollars for someone to do it? I would really appreciate any kind of help, this is my dream project!

With The Odin Project and FreeCodeCamp, I was able to learn HTML and CSS quite quickly. JavaScript is significantly more difficult.

Now I've found the book ""Head First JavaScript"" and I have the impression that it perfectly matches my ""zone of proximal development (ZPD)."" So far it was never too difficult or too boring.
I love it.

The book is written in a varied style, demonstrates many things, then encourages independent thinking with small exercises, and provides the solutions a few pages later for comparison.

Of course, it's a form of hand-holding, but for me as a JavaScript beginner, it's the perfect mix to start with—motivating yet challenging.

I'm a junior in college studying civil engineering, a degree in which you don't need to know anything about anything when it comes to coding. Despite that, I've started learning Python with Harvard's free online CS50 course. This is because:

1) I find it personally interesting
2) I'd like to have a marketable skill that sets me apart from my peers
3) I'd like to be able to work on projects for some side income

I chose Python because it's quite beginner-friendly and has applications in data processing, scraping, automation, among others.

I don't think that I'm interested in achieving mastery of the language. I want to reach a level where I can write code well and be able to market my skills as a freelancer. I'm expecting this to take at least 1.5-2 years of learning and practice with coding projects.

It's honestly a dream of mine to be able to travel the world in my 20s, and to be able to have a source of income (even if it's not much) from doing remote work cleaning data (or something similar) would be even better. This is on top of the benefit that I think I'd receive in my career from having this skill.

My questions are:

1) Look, I know developers are crucial and can't be easily replaced by robots. But do y'all think that a couple years of actively learning Python will make me competitive against AI that can write fast, free code? I'm not trying to offend anyone, but it's just that at this point I clearly don't know how good AI's code is or what I could be capable of after 2 years.

2) Assuming I stick to a niche like web scraping or automation, do y'all think I could get paid well by doing projects for people as a freelancer? Say, $50+/hr?

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p7ax9h/naming_things_in_really_complex_situations_and_as,Naming things in really complex situations and as,"Naming has become a real challenge for me. It’s easy when I’m following a YouTube tutorial and building mock projects, but in real production projects it gets difficult. In the beginning it’s manageable, but as the project grows, naming things becomes harder.

For example, I have various formatters. A formatter takes a database object—basically a Django model instance—and formats it. It’s similar to a serializer, though I have specific reasons to create my own instead of using the built-in Python or Django REST Framework serializers. The language or framework isn’t the main point here; I’m mentioning them only for clarity.

So I create one formatter that returns some structured data. Then I need another formatter that returns about 80% of the same data, but with slight additions or removals. There might be an order formatter, then another order formatter with user data, another one without the “order received” date, and so on. None of this reflects my actual project—it’s not e-commerce but an internal tool I can’t discuss in detail—but it does involve many formatters for different use cases. Depending on the role, I may need to send different versions of order data with certain fields blank. This is only the formatter situation.

Then there are formatters that include user roles, order formatters that also include product details, and other combinations. Sometimes it doesn’t make sense to separate order and product formatters, but in rare cases I need a product formatter with only an order number or something similar, so I end up creating another formatter because the original one didn’t include it.

Beyond formatters, naming functions, classes, methods, getters, and setters also becomes difficult. I know that when naming becomes hard, it may indicate that the code isn’t following the Single Responsibility Principle. But I’m not always sure how to handle this.

For example, I might be building an interface that lets users update their data. An admin can update emails, phone numbers, and roles, but a regular user can only update their name. This leads to functions like `update_user_with_role`, `update_user_normal`, `update_user_with_email`, and so on.

Most of my projects have role-based access control, and different roles can view or update different fields. Sometimes even the displayed values differ. For example, if an admin views an order, they might see quantity 100, but a vendor might see quantity 70 because the order is split between two vendors. That means writing multiple getters, different database queries, and various ways of manipulating the data. This leads to many functions and a lot of naming decisions.

Inside a single function, I often deal with dictionaries (like objects in JavaScript). I might fetch raw data from the database, give it a long descriptive name, remove some parts, process it again, and so on. I end up naming the same dictionary multiple times in different forms, and the names become long and messy. I’m unsure what the right approach is here.

Tutorials usually cover only obvious examples aimed at beginners. They say things like “If you calculate tax, call it `calculate_tax`,” which is obvious. But my real-world cases aren’t that simple. If discounts depend on user roles, sure, the logic should be inside the function, but I still need to express it clearly. I also don’t want to get stuck overthinking names because that delays the project.

Name collisions happen a lot. For example, I once wrote a function called `get_user` to fetch a user by ID. Later I needed to fetch users by email, username, and other fields. I ended up writing multiple versions, and the original vague name became a problem because it was created early in the project. I eventually renamed it, but it was painful. That’s why I want a better approach from the start so I don’t spend hours worrying about names.

Sometimes it feels easier to write the logic itself. I never use meaningless names like `a` or `x1`, but I do end up writing temporary or placeholder names like “this\_has\_to\_be\_renamed”. Then I move on to the next function and write “this\_is\_not\_right\_first\_has\_to\_be\_renamed”, and so on. These names aren’t helpful, but they let me continue writing code without getting stuck on naming.

So I’m looking for any guide, project, or glossary I can refer to—something with common naming patterns. For instance, I used words like “collection” or “group” earlier, but “batch” made more sense in my context. I’ve used AI suggestions often; sometimes they help, sometimes they produce vague names because they don’t have the full context.

I’m not sure if there is any practical guide, but if there is, please share it. Or share any tips that can help me improve. Naming shouldn’t be something that holds me back; I’d rather focus on the logic instead. Thank you."

Still, I often feel that I have a lot more to learn even though i have come a long way from the beggining.

My question to you is what was a breakthrough book/college course or anything similar that made think differently when you try to implement the ideas in your head to well structured, uncoupled code with proper interfaces."

How should I approach this?

I’m curious about how does plagiarism checker work. There are lots of tools like Grammarly, Quetext, Scribbr, EssayPro, Turnitin and so on - they all are considered to be the most accurate and reliable but I'm more curious about how they actually work.

Like.. how do they actually detect the similarity between two pieces of text or code?

Do they use techniques like hashing, fingerprinting or maybe some machine learning to compare meaning?

And if I wanted to build a plagiarism checker in Python, what would be a good approach to take?

Also, has anyone tried developing a plagiarism detector for students that actually works on code files (not just essays)? I'd love to hear how you'd structure that. Thanks!"

When this happens, the selected pixel (""pixel"" is an object I created) is also set to ""processed"" meaning this pixel has already been worked on, don't perform the averaging operation on it again. This implies that the random selector method I'm using can choose any pixel it wants to while running, so multiple pixels get selected multiple times. This is inefficient. How could I also exclude them from the set of values the random method can select? I was thinking about putting all the pixel values in a linked list and then knocking them out that way with a checkinlist(pixel) method, but maybe a hash table would be better?"

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p6sep4/how_do_you_effectively_compare_yourselfstudy,How do you effectively compare yourselfstudy,"I often take advice too literally and get confused on how I should specifically structure my agenda when learning formal math, programming, and computer science.

I've made a lot of poor assumptions and ended up in a bottleneck where I'm not really improving in any of these three sectors  listed within computational mathematics/CS or software engineering.

 Because software engineering is usually an asynchronous isolated discipline it's hard to figure out what I am doing wrong and what other people are doing right, especially since people like to summarize and avoid being pedantic, but I don't always know what people mean by their advice.

Sometimes I wish I could watch other people develop software or solve algorithmic in real time, read their notes and their learning journey in a biographical timeline. When I try to ask other students they might say ""I learnt from a young age from parents or other tutors"", or that ""they made projects that they liked and just coded a lot"",  I don't really get to observe the specifics of what they're doing the way you can study someone when they're playing a sport or some other visible activity.

 I was told mathematics was the main foundation behind computer science that is mainly unchanging compared to programming languages, libraries and toolkits which change constantly, I thought it would be best if I invested most of my time into studying math while taking 'intro to CS' and intro to 'x programming language tutorials', just trying to focus on passing my CS degree and computational mathematics first before exploring a specific software engineering discipline.

I thought that once I understood the mathematics understanding how to translate concepts into code would be as straightforward as making functions for arithmetic operations or other ideas people intuitively understand.  But if you brought a mathematician with no programming experience in a structured course they would not understand how to program an addition function in python or C++ either.

I should not have focused so much on math and expected the information to immediately convert to programming skill or at least make the implementation side obvious. In my intro to DSA class we didn’t even use discrete math or linear algebra, so there was no reason to take all 3 classes at the same time with no way to tie the classes together, but the curriculum made me do this. 

Eventually in my classes I reached a point where I was told despite how much I tried to study the math and computer science concepts in pseudocode, I couldn't implement anything, i couldn't code. I was confused as I tried to engage as much as I could in my intro to x language-intermediate x language classes, asking questions, going to office hours(which in intermediate java for example was usually swamped because we were given 'real projects'/'toy projects' as assignments after going over a small topic in class, and the professor told us to figure it out)

When I asked how I should have learnt to code I was told to mainly ""make more personal projects from scratch"" and just to ""code more""

I wasn't sure where that meant for me to start.  While I knew I was hardly software engineer material, I thought I was at least making enough progress to code the computer science concepts in my classes but I wasn't, especially since we didn't focus on literal technical problems but toy projects/ ""real world scenarios"" using the algorithm in ways that we couldn't directly google because it was a unique scenario project, and we didn't actually code in class because we were told ""I'm not teaching you how to program, I'm teaching you computer science.""

Should I do leetcode and seek computational problems to solve? I tried that and I was no more prepared for the mini software assignments given in class.

Should I choose a specific field of software engineering and just start learning the tools through example projects before branching off into my own  project ideas? A lot of the programming  libraries/tools were too niche and abstract,  taking away time trying to study a specific library itself rather than the programming/ software engineering principles I was trying to gain from practicing programming with those tools to apply to my classes.

I tried to read books on software design, but the books talked more about general project cycle principles such as readable  and  reusable code, good documentation, but computer architecture talked about low level concepts such as the ALU of which studying wasn't helping me program any better at the time nor did I fully understand.

I started trying to program projects from my imagination, especially since I was told ""don't use tutorials, code from scratch, employers don't care about clone/derivate projects"" which always ended up with me taking a bunch of notes on the documentation trying to study what enumeration is  or watching a bunch of mini tutorials on different classes in a toolkit I thought might be relevant to my project for weeks on end, with no actual progress on the project being made, just dismembered pieces of code in test files which I definitely can't put on my resume either."

I founded a marketing agency a while back, and have always been the go-to for web dev, QC, and other stuff (SEO, UX, responsiveness etc). This is partly because websites aren't a primary 'revenue source' and that good talent is expensive. But mainly because - **I just fucking love to code**.

I started out with Bootstrap, lot of template editing + debugging, moved onto CMSes like Wordpress and HubSpot, and got a fair understanding of React/JS frameworks on the way. This was mainly for brand websites, so little to no web app development (although I've helped clients with app interfaces and debugging on the way).

While web dev hasn't been a primary focus, and probably never will be, I'm weirdly obsessed with good web experiences. Mixing design with dev is my therapy-replacement, and I want to be better at it.

I'd think of myself as an intermediate web developer, even though I've spent less than enough time on it. I'm an engineer-turned-marketer, so I have a fair understanding of programming concepts as well. I just want to be better - and I'm having a hard time figuring out where to start.

I like threeJS and GSAP, although the learning curve feels a little intimidating. I feel like Scrimba and Boot.Dev(maybe more backend?) might be a good place to start. I'm prone to picking things up then dropping them quickly - so I'd ideally not want to put in a lot of money as a subscription (the currency exchange rate makes the $ a little painful).

So you think at this point ""okay bro, now you know how people learn by building projects and connecting the dots to make functional software, congrats"". But no amount of knowing about it saved me from the fundamental power fantasy of tutorials! Because that's what following the 10th tutorial in a row is about: Consuming the solution to problems someone else stumbled onto, in order to feel like you're making progress fast.

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p6ewap/my_first_serious_side_project_chrome_extension,My first serious side project chrome extension,"Hey everyone 👋

I’ve been working on a small side-project to improve my own productivity, and I’d love some feedback from fellow developers.

I built a Chrome extension called **TabClock** — it tracks how much time you spend on each website *per day*, tab by tab. I made it because I caught myself jumping between tabs while coding, losing focus, and I wanted something simple that shows **“how long have I been on this tab?”** directly in the tab title and popup.

🔗 Demo/website: [**https://tabclock.site/**](https://tabclock.site/)

# Why I built it

* I wanted a lightweight alternative to big productivity tools
* I wanted to practice building with **Chrome Extensions (Manifest V3)**
* I wanted to experiment with background timers, storage syncing, and tab state management
* And honestly… to stop myself from spending “5 minutes” on YouTube that somehow turn into 40

# What I learned while building it

* Handling tab changes efficiently (tracking active tab, switching timers, saving state)
* Using `chrome.storage.local` vs syncing intervals to avoid too many writes
* Avoiding timer drift in background scripts
* Managing performance when tracking multiple domains
* Syncing UI between popup → background → content script

# Current features

* Time spent per domain for the current day
* Live timer on active tab (updates every second)
* History stored locally
* Clean popup overview of today’s time
* Simple total-time formatting (hours/mins/secs)

# What I’d love feedback on

* Code quality – what would you structure differently?
* Any anti-patterns / bad habits I should fix early
* How to better architect the background worker
* Ideas for improving analytics without over-engineering
* Is the UI too simple or fine for now?

# If you’ve built Chrome extensions before…

I’d really appreciate any thoughts on:

* Managing state across multiple tabs
* Storage efficiency
* Best practices for timers in Manifest V3
* Whether I should move to a more modular architecture

I’m not trying to promote anything — this is purely a learning project that I want to improve.
If you check it out, I’d love any feedback 🙏"

I'm trying to set up a redirect at the domain level.

After lots of back and forth with Shopify Support offering wrong solutions, we finally got to the suggestion that I keep ""domain-b.com"" as an alias domain to our homepage and add a script in theme.liquid inside the head to redirect visitors from the alias root to the page.

Now, I'm in a little over my head. Is this suggestion likely to actually work, or is Shopify still giving me the wrong solution? And if so, where do I even begin on syntax? I am primarily an HTML/CSS person—I sort of presume I'll need Javascript to write this, no? My end goal in terms of logic here is ""if user enters with <domain-b.com>, send them to <domain-a.com/pages/domain-b>. If user enters with <domain-a.com>, keep them at <domain-a.com>.""

I need your help picking a book to expand my knowledge in fundamentals of computer science.

I am a mechanical engineering major, and about 3 years ago I decided to switch careers and learn programming. Thing is, while doing this, I focused more on hands on knowledge that will help me find a job, not fundamentals. I started with Harward's CS50 course for some basics, then learned Java and Spring, basics of SQL and Git, and then a bit of data structures and algorithms. After about 8-9 months, I landed a job and started working.

Currently, I am feeling that I missed a lot of fundamental topics and I would like to cover the blank spots before I can further improve. I have no problem understanding any technical topics, I have always been a good student, and math/physics/engineering was always my forte.

I feel like I need to cover the following topics: Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Computer Networking and Database Systems. I understand that all of these topics are broad enough to cover several books by themselves, but reality is, I don't have that much time to dedicate to studying each topic.

Hence, I would like a recommendation of a single book (preferably, but it can also be a video course) that would give me an overall knowledge on all of these topics, so that when the need arises, I would at least know where to look for more detailed info. What I am looking for, is a book for self-taught programmers like myself, to cover some of the more glaring blank spots, that would also give enough fundamental knowledge so that I can later dive deeper into any specific subject.

A few of them felt like they relied a bit too much on trial and error, so I turned that curiosity into a small side project. I built a browser extension that reads the puzzle when you open it, figures out the pattern, and then gives hints or can even solve it automatically. Right now it only works with the “Zip” puzzle, but I’m planning to expand it as I go.

While building this, I ended up learning way more than I expected. I got a much better understanding of how Chrome extensions are structured, how to use content scripts to interact with a page, and how to scrape and interpret the DOM in a way that doesn’t break when the site loads things dynamically. I also had to figure out how to design simple pattern-recognition logic, handle communication between different parts of the extension, and work through a bunch of timing issues that I’d never really run into before. Publishing it taught me how the Chrome Web Store process works too. Overall, it was a fun reminder that small projects are often the best way to learn things you didn’t even know you needed.

I’m looking for some honest advice from people in tech.

I recently got an internship offer, but it’s not exactly what I expected. My main goal is to become a **Java/Spring Boot Full Stack developer**, and I’ve been actively learning Java, Spring Boot, SQL, API development, etc.

However, the internship role they are offering is:

* Mostly **fieldwork** (visiting clients, training them on software, handling support)
* Not a developer position at the beginning
* They said I might move into development **later**
* But their main tech stack is **JavaScript + Python**, not Java
* They also told me to learn **JavaScript ES** first before they consider development tasks

So right now the internship is more like **technical support / client training**, not backend engineering.

I’m worried that if I accept it, I might end up spending months in a non-coding role and drift away from my Java backend path.

**My question is:**
👉 Should I join this internship even though it doesn’t match my tech stack?
👉 Has anyone started in support/field roles and successfully transitioned into backend later?
👉 Or is it better to wait and focus on getting a proper backend-related internship?

Would love to hear different opinions or experiences.
Thanks in advance!"

I know a few languages, python, html, css, js and dart. Also I know the basic dsa concept starting from linked lists to graphs, and from bubble sort to dfs and bfs. I never really worked on advanced project besides making a soduko backtracker solver using python and making a recipe checker that checks your ingredients and shows you the best recipes based on the ingredients you have (no api integration just hashmaps and a few recipes) using tkinter besides that nothing too advanced also i barely know how to integrate apis.

I wanted to step up my coding skills I didn't know how until i stumbled to web game made by Nicky Case called ""The Wisdom and/or Madness of Crowds (https://ncase.me/crowds/)"". it's a really clever game and i noticed that the whole gimmick of the game relied on graphs its only 30 min play time max so i'd recomend it. I checked the codespace (its on her github if your interested to see her projects. she has many more interesting games similar to this one) it was complete giberish to me so i wanted some advice or a roadmap to be able to make a game similar to her. the game im making i thought it out it basically uses graphs as the main gimmick and also ""simulation"" not in the normal sense in like a simple equation sense and it changes by ""step"".

If possible can someone give me a roadmap to what i should learn, the frameworks and/or libs i need to achieve the first advanced project i'll make. let me know if its too ambitious as well so I can focus my learning in something else.

thank you so much

note: this is my first time working with frameworks"

I have extremely poor memory, and complicated health issues that require me to keep track of things. If I had something that could listen to me constantly, so it can remind me of things, like, kind of silly but very real example for me, when I say ""My back really hurts"" it can be like ""reminder that you strained a muscle in your back last Monday, the 24th"" because injuries are something that happened frequently and in complex ways for me, so I forget they happened. And I try to keep track of it all myself, but then I have to remember to go look somewhere. I just don't want that data being spread or even sold to God knows where. I don't want to become an unwilling case study or just be spied on whatsoever. I want my data to stay with me. If I could make something that's just a memory card for whatever program I make and to hold data as it comes, with a speaker and microphone, I feel I could greatly improve my life. I would be willing to record the voice for it as well, whatever I have to do. If this is something thats possible I would be willing to put a lot of work in and money for the programs as well."

So I just watched Traversy Media's new video on learning to code in 2025, and it kinda went against something I see posted here all the time.

Pretty much every ""how do I start"" thread has people saying ""avoid AI like the plague at the beginning""—which makes total sense. You need to build that problem-solving muscle, learn to read docs, and struggle through errors yourself.

But Brad's take was that the ecosystem is just too massive now to memorize everything, and AI can work \*if\* you use it as a supplemental tutor, not a code generator. The whole point is to pair it with a structured course (like Udemy or Coursera) and use it to understand concepts, not get answers.

He shared this specific prompt to keep the AI in ""tutor mode"":

\> I am currently taking \[Course Name\] by \[Instructor\]. I want you to act as my personal coding assistant and tutor. Do not do the work for me. Help me understand concepts in depth, explain code examples in plain English, and suggest small practice challenges based on each lesson.

The idea is it should explain \*why\* things work, quiz you, and fill in gaps when you're stuck—basically a 24/7 teaching assistant.

I'm torn because on one hand, having something instantly clarify a confusing concept sounds amazing. On the other hand, isn't the pain of digging through Stack Overflow part of how you actually learn?

For those of you who are self-taught, where do you personally draw the line? I'm about to start a React course and I'm honestly debating between going old school (docs + trial and error) vs. trying this AI tutor approach.

Does using AI as an explainer actually help retention, or does it just become a fancy shortcut? Would love to hear some real-world takes from people further along."

So I’m a programmer who’s been diving into some computer science fundamentals through books and just tinkering around with code. Nothing too big, not full-on projects, just exploring concepts. The thing is, I feel a bit stuck because I don’t have a lot of project ideas to apply what I’m learning. And honestly, I’m not sure if “learning by doing” is the right approach for me right now. It feels like there’s a huge emphasis in programming circles on just jumping in and building stuff, but in other fields like medicine or other branches of engineering, you spend a lot more time on theory before you start doing anything practical.

So I’m curious to hear from you all: Did you have a moment where you finally felt confident enough to start building things? What was your breakthrough? And how did you get over that feeling of “I need to know everything before I start”? I’d love to hear your stories and get some advice on taking that step into actually building something real or even contributing to open source. Thanks!

EDIT : Wow thanks a lot for all the responses, it was really helpful to read about your experiences. I’ll definitely use your advice in my journey!"

I’m in a programming/IT course and I need to deliver a final project.
I chose to build a:

**“Virtual Environment Builder for Custom Furniture Planning”**

The idea is:

* The user can generate a room (width, height, length)
* Place custom furniture inside it
* And eventually view everything in VR (Oculus Quest)

I’m developing it with **Unity 6 + C#**, starting with a simple *Room Generator*.
But honestly, the learning curve is hitting me hard: materials, scripts, hierarchy, UI, VR, OpenXR… it feels like a lot all at once.
I’m still only on the room-generation part and it already feels complicated.

My question is:
**Should I switch the project to a Web-based solution (Three.js/Babylon.js), which might be easier to develop?**
Or should I stick with Unity because the final quality and possibilities are better?

The plan was to make a simple 3D PC version first, and only add VR later if I have time.
What would you do in my situation?

Thanks!"

However when I run it on Ubuntu on my laptop it has a tendency to 'swallow' records or even loop endlessly for larger amounts of records (50k and above, maybe a bit below too), it happens very frequently, about half the time if not more often. still works fine for smaller amounts though.

 To check I installed WSL on my laptop too (I have dual boot) and it ran fine and dandy there too. What could possibly be the reason behind this? g++ version on Ubuntu and WSL is the same, so is the block size.

I've handed in my code already so what's done is done on that front. It is a bit of an odd situation though so idk.

deck = \[{'value': 'Q', 'suit': '♥'}, {'value': '9', 'suit': '♠'}.....\] and so on through every card type

I then shuffle the deck,

after shuffling I give the player 2 cards and the dealer a min of 3 cards and a max of 5 (depending on user input), by popping each handed card out of the deck (so the deck list shrinks with each card handed out).

now that the cards have been handed out I make a new list

final\_cards = player\_cards + dealer\_cards

these lists store the cards in the same way as the deck ie

Player cards are:
\[{'value': 'Q', 'suit': '♥'}, {'value': '9', 'suit': '♠'}\]

Dealer cards are:

\[{'value': '4', 'suit': '♠'}, {'value': '7', 'suit': '♥'}, {'value': '5', 'suit': '♦'}\]

My undergrad was in business, and I never got to study CS formally — but I’ve always had a strong interest in technology, building things (cloud, software, architecture), and more technical work.

Here’s my situation:

* My experience so far is functional ERP consulting, with exposure to SQL and other technical components of ERP and enterprise applications.
* I have an opportunity internally to move into a more technical consulting role, working with front-end technologies like JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, etc.
* I’m working on growing my technical skills to make myself a strong candidate for a CS master’s by no later than Fall of 27 (I'm 26).

What I want help with:

1. Should I pursue the technical internal role now, or focus on self-study / side projects first to prepare for a CS master’s?
2. What skills or positions would be most valuable to build before applying?
3. What are common pitfalls for mid-career people applying for CS master’s programs, especially without a CS undergrad?
4. How can I maximize the ROI of the master’s — i.e., make sure it leads to a better technical job post-graduation?

I’m serious about this pivot and willing to put in the work. I’d really appreciate brutally honest feedback, especially from folks who’ve made a similar switch or who’ve supported people doing so.

So was the original version of Facebook (2004) hard or easy to code. Or could anybody with decent/good coding skills actually do it easily. Could somebody with decent, good or super good programming skills do the same.

Was Mark Zuckerberg a programming genius or did he just have a good idea. What skills are required to actually build the 2004 version of Facebook.

And what parts did you actually have to code Frontend? Backend?

What language was used and is that language hard to learn or master?"

Im looking for another job but find I’m always lacking what I’ll call the “enterprise” tools on my resume. So things like cloud computing, security, experience on larger distributed systems, containers, Azure, AWS etc etc.

Does anyone have suggestions on courses that cover some of these more corporate level tools or just advice on how to develop those skills in my own?"

I've been studying programming on my own and I'm currently working on data structures. I feel like I'm doing well, but I'd like to hear the opinions of experts or more experienced people for recommendations."
https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p4cn3p/kind_of_lost_on_what_field_of_programming_i_want,Kind of lost on what field of programming i want,"I originally studied computer networking (my high school grades weren’t high enough for CS), but I dropped out and basically spent the COVID years working minimum-wage jobs. When I finally decided to go back to school, I realized I had zero motivation to finish networking. I always wanted to do programming, and since I’d been away for so long, I would’ve had to retake a ton of courses anyway. Honestly, I only went into networking in the first place because I felt pressured to “go to university and not upset my parents.”

When I was younger, I used to make little calculator/optimizer apps for games using Visual Basic .NET with drag-and-drop GUI tools, and that was genuinely fun. I also made a mini DDR-style “time my key press” game in Java for a high school project, and that was a big “wow” moment for me.

Right now I’m in community college and self-studying on the side (university is just too expensive for me at the moment).

The problem is: when I try to think of portfolio or hobby projects, I draw a complete blank. Everyone says to “find problems in your interests/hobbies,” but I barely have time for hobbies anymore. I used to watch anime and play games, but with part-time jobs + studying + schoolwork, I’m lucky if I get an hour on Steam these days.

I’m debating learning Java or C# because they seem useful for my local job market, but I also feel like choosing a language *just* for that reason might be a trap. And even if I pick one… I still have no idea *what* to build.

Has anyone else gone through this?
Is the only real approach just diving into random projects to see what sticks?

Right now I’m studying SQL, C++, Express/Node, and teaching myself TypeScript by converting my school JS assignments into TS. (I should probably get into React as it seems like its the new minimum standard for programmer -.-;"

For context, I'm trying to find the hidden prices off of an australian real estate website called [homely.com.au](http://homely.com.au) by changing the price filters with a playwright automation.

I came across this error.

The results look like this instead of a real price range: 31/24-30 Parramatta Street, Cronulla NSW 2230 $1,600,000 – $1,600,000 5/19-23 Marlo Road, Cronulla NSW 2230 $1,300,000 – $1,300,000 21 Green Street, Cronulla NSW 2230 $2,250,000 – $2,250,000 3 Portsmouth Street, Cronulla NSW 2230 $3,500,000 – $3,500,000

The real results that I manually got from the homely website look like this: 31/24-30 Parramatta Street, Cronulla NSW 2230 $1,500,000 – $1,600,000 5/19-23 Marlo Road, Cronulla NSW 2230 $1,200,000 – $1,300,000 21 Green Street, Cronulla NSW 2230 $2,000,000 – $2,250,000 3 Portsmouth Street, Cronulla NSW 2230 $3,000,000 – $3,500,000.

So essentially I just want the minimum price to be shown properly but apparently it's a lot harder than it looks.

Would love your help!

I am not bad with logic building. Infact I am pretty good. But trying to learn every theory there is messes up my mind as well as takes away a lot of time. I feel overwhelmed.

I want to start building robots, or small projects here and there, but the thing is I'm only a beginner at programming. I've learnt C++ a couple of months ago through a course I've been taking as a part of my degree. But, the only thing we've learnt are the basic stuff. Loops storing variables, and some simple math stuff, nothing really fancy. I thought we're going to learn more, but the last lecture was about functions and now we're are working on a group project, and that's it the course is done, and I don't know how to build things with C++. I only know how to add and make loops. I know that those things are the roots to build robots and any small projects but the thing is I won't be able to learn that at Uni. I need to learn more but IDK from where to start, what Youtube channel to learn from etc. Can you guys recommend me some resources or tips that I might need in the future when I'm making any kind of projects, please?"
