I think I understand this but I’d like some clarification if needed; if I flip a fair coin 99 times and it lands on heads each time, the 100th flip still has a 50/50 chance to land on heads, yes?

But if I flip a coin 100 times, starting now, the chances of it landing on heads each time is not 50/50, and rather astronomically lower, right?

Essentially, each flip is always 50/50, since the coin flip is an individual event, but the chances of landing on heads 100 times in succession is not an individual event and rather requires each 50/50 chance to consistently land on heads.

>We hypothesized that non-native provenances would show (i) declining growth performance with increasing distance between provenance origin and trial site, and (ii) phenological differences to local oaks that increased with latitudinal differences between origin and trial site. Under a local adaptation hypothesis, we predicted declining gall-wasp abundance with increasing phenological mismatch between native and cli-mate-matched trees. Both hypotheses for oaks were supported. Provenance explained signiﬁcant variation in gall wasp abundance, but no gall type showed the relationship between abundance and phenological mismatch predicted by a local adaptation hypothesis. Our results show that climate matching would have complex and variable impacts on oak gall communities

We set a Snickers bar on fire and we get 250 calories.

How does that translate to eating a Snickers bar? Digestion is chewing food, sending it to the stomach to be broken down into a slurry from stomach acid and enzymes, released into the intestines, and nutrients absorbed.

I don't understand how figuring out hot a Snickers bar makes water when you light it on fire corresponds to the amount of energy it gives a human body, but everything in nutrition revolves around this idea of calories."

Prized by the European ruling classes, many spices were treated as precious commodities and priced as such.

But this question is less about history or economics, and more about ecology:

Why is it that so many things considered ‘spices’ originated (or at least flourished) in the Indian subcontinent? Many spices seem completely unrelated to each other and come from very different parts of the plant.

It seems notable that so many different plants with aromatic, flavourful bits should all be concentrated in one (admittedly quite large) region, while Europe didn’t have (for example) any similar trees whose bark could be stripped and used like cinnamon.

Is there something specific to the ecology of India/southern Asia that somehow lends itself to growing fragrant plants? Are a lot of spices more closely related to each other than I’m assuming?

In terms of climate and ecology why was Europe so bereft of ‘spice plants’ that it lavished such enormous sums of money on importing them from across the seas?"

“If you can save and invest through a tax-sheltered retirement account…you don’t need actually to cut your spending by 10 percent to reach a savings goal of 10 percent (of your gross income). When you contribute money to a tax-deductible retirement account, you reduce your federal and state taxes. If you’re a moderate-income-earner paying, say, 30 percent in federal and state taxes on your marginal income, you actually need to reduce your spending by only 7 percent to save 10 percent. The other 3 percent of the savings comes from the lowering of your taxes.”

I am having a hard time wrapping my head around this- if you’re already contributing 10% to a retirement account, why would you need to cut your spending to actually be saving 10%?

I understand that the ""observer"" in quantum physics isn't literally a conscious person observing a wave/particle. In the ""double slit"" experiment, it's the physical mechanism of the detection device that collapses the wave function. Any interaction with any other thing will cause a collapse into a discrete knowable particle.

But then how do quantum super positions exist at all? There should be none in our bodies, because all of the atoms and energy that make up our cells are always interacting with something. Even in the vacuum of space, there's still cosmic rays and background radiation, right? Do quantum states only exist in laboratory conditions where scientists can control for these?

How do scientists who do the double slit experiment with hydrogen atoms find ones that haven't collapsed into particles yet? This seems to imply that there are atoms on Earth that exist in super positions, but I don't see how they could be on this planet for billions of years without bumping into something else at least once. Are super position atoms very rare atoms? How would you find the rare ones without interacting with them when you check, and immediately collapsing them?

Do particles somehow un-collapse after a refractory period, so the universe is still full of them despite all of the interactions constantly going on? If so, does an electron with a particular spin still have that same spin if it collapses again, or does it totally reset every time?"

https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1pgzgzq/eli5_how_do_mathematicians_come_up_with_new,Eli5 how do mathematicians come up with new,"This is something that has always boggled me. Despite browsing and reading the interwebs, I am still left confused. So far I've gathered that:

1) A new number system can be defined as a set of values, and two operations, a + and a * with properties for each of them

Let us take positive integers for a moment. The set of values would be 1 till +inf. The operations + and * would be addition and multiplication. So that would describe how the system of positive integers work

I then read about quaternions. Instead of one real value, you have 3 complex values and 1 real value. You get two operations yes, but said operations lose properties compared to what we had with positive integers (no associativity for instance), which seemed arbitrary to me. And these go on and on with octonions, hyperreals, extensions of number systems and what not leaving me very confused

I) Who defines what a new system looks or works like? For example with the simplest case of positive integers, what defined multiplication to work that way? If that operation only needs commutativity and associativity, couldn't there be MANY suitable operations with those properties that aren't exactly like multiplication?

II) What's with the weird loss of properties? Complexes lose easy magnitude comparisons, quaternions lose associativity of multiplication and so on. Why can't we just define a quaternion system that just happens to have associative multiplication?"

Then, again, As I wrote, I started thinking I've never seen an adult go over the bar. I never saw a kid do this either. I feel like I could throw a swing and get it to loop once over the bar.

I thought maybe that thing where you can put water in a bucket and swing it around and the water stays in a bucket could be related to this. Or maybe a Newton's cradle.

Speaking from personal experience as a researcher teaching college with late-diagnosed ADHD and ADD. I’ve always been fascinated by this topic. As someone who now lives a fulfilled life with a fulfilling job, I had always thought myself neurotypical - until I observed some neurodivergent traits in my son and began looking for a diagnosis (whelp, turned out I was the one who checked all the boxes haha) I excelled in school as a child (top 1% in most standardized tests) but exhibited lots of challenging behavioral patterns (eg. failure to pay attention to any sort of lecture; despising authority and flipping middle finger at my math teacher because I found his class too easy at the age of 6; difficulty socializing with classmates; shaking head and flapping hands unself-consciously when listening to my favorite music; severe gastrointestinal symptoms that only responds to SSRI medication, etc.) All these behavioral patterns became more of less eased or went away as I aged and built my own coping mechanisms. But back then nobody told me that it was a form of neurodivergence (ADHD/ASD).

My question is, if the law of natural selection (“the survival of the fittest”) stands, shouldn’t people like me have gone extinct a long time ago (I mean we have genes that create harm and mental challenges for ourselves; so in theory, those genes ideally should’ve been weeded out by natural or social competition, right?)

Looking at metal halides along the metal reactivity chart, there seems to be a line between corrosive/edible at aluminium. (AlCl is corrosive, MgCl, one higher on the reactivity scale, is edible)

I think that comes to the ability of the metal to reduce the halogen, making a relatively neutral molecule. Does that mean that if you use a less reactive halogen (maybe a theoretical heavier element) any metal halide can in theory be made edible? What determines the “edibility” of it?

The reason for this line of thought was an idea about an “iron table salt” just like “potassium table salt” exists"

So, basically, from reading, given the same amount of current through a particular conductor,

The inductance of a conductor (PCB trace) is determined almost entirely by the geometry of the current loop it forms with its return path.

Smaller loop = smaller field = lower inductance.
Larger loop = larger field = higher inductance.

Not trace width, not copper weight — but field volume and return path coupling.

Still can't wrap my head that inductance is not dependent on current and length of the conductor, but it depends on the loop formed by the conductor (field volume) from source to it's return.

How does geometry play a role rather than the strength of the current or the length of the conductor ?

How is the physics working here? Is there some special engineering that keeps them upright or is it just because the ship itself is so heavy at the bottom? And how do they even figure out where to put each container so the weight is distributed properly?

Also saw that sometimes containers do fall off into the ocean during storms. If the ships are designed to be stable, why does this happen? Is it just when the waves get too crazy or is there some limit to how much movement these things can handle?

Do computer musicians or producers ever take a laptop and make dubstep long after it was mainstream?

Is this ever done with different skills, like programming a computer, knitting, or ham radio morse code?

Wha are they testing for, and what will they avoid? If it's brain cancer, why not sacrifice your skills if it means you won't have any of the tumor in the brain? It's interesting considering that brain surgery and psych medication embrace opposite approaches: it's socially acceptable to cause people tinnitus, cortical thinning and changed personalities to make them seem socially nicer with antipsychotics, yet removing a tumor has to stop when there's the slightest sign of reduced skill on an instrument.

A previous one had the scenario where myself and a friend in Norway clap at the same time: suppose we both synchronize watches according an atomic clock and agree at a set time per UDT we clap, and then do, to the observer flying past with FTL communication from their perspective the friend in Norway claps first, and if they instantly tell me this the information arrives before the event that triggered it happened.

What I don't understand is how the sequence of events can be subjective, instead of the PERCEPTION of the events.  My issue with the previous explanation is that if we are clapping at the same time, then we both clap. The light from my friend clapping reaches the observer first, but light and information carrying my own clapping has also already begun, since we have arranged to clap simultaneously: we have accounted for our locations relative to one another and the planet's motion in our timing, let us say perfectly so. Each of us from our perspective claps at that same moment.

Let us say Dr. Manhattan appears inside the earth, precisely midway between us, and sees through the land to look at us directly, and watches us at the same time: he sees the reflected light bounce off us when we clap and head in his direction at the same time, the same speed.

From his perspective, looking both ways at once, wouldn't it appear to be synchronized?

Let's say further Dr. Manhattan agrees to tell us via light-speed communications who he sees clap first, or if it appears at the same time.

He would eventually say ""You both have clapped at the same time.""

Wouldn't the observer still be bound by causality despite FTL travel of information?

Sure, they can radio me via instant comms and say ""Your friend in Norway clapped"" the instant they see it, but by then I have clapped and my light is on its way to both him and Dr. Manhattan.

Time dilation and FTL comms would allow him to say ""Your friend in Norway clapped"" before seeing me do it, and before Dr. Manhattan could tell me anything, but wouldn't it still be after I had clapped? Clearly I'm missing something but I don't understand how it breaks causality. The limiting factor in ""real life"" instead of a thought experiment is that you would need greater than infinite energy to travel beyond light speed and communicate or interact, which is impossible for its own reasons.

What am I not understanding about ""relativity of simultaneity"" here? I accept that FTL comms are impossible as we understand physics, I just don't understand it. I can't find a good example that clarifies WHY it is impossible."

At some point surnames must have been different for every generation so that you'd know specifically that Carl Sørensen was Søren's son, and then his son's surname would be Carlsen.

From what I read, many merchant ships today use their power plants 100% to generate electricity. Those ships have their propellers powered by electric motors that get power from the ships' power grid. Therefore, there is no mechanical connection between the power generating engines and the propellers.

OTOH, warships keep the old architecture by having shafts connecting the propellers to the engines. Why is that? AFAIK, having electric motors for the propellers enables the ships to be more maneuverable, as the propellers can be directed to almost all directions."

Thank you for everyone who answered! I didn't account for the fact that certain organs in my body like my brain and heart are the same size as and require just as much energy as every other human, and that certain parts of my body like my muscles are smaller which is why I have less excess calorie burn but still require a minimum of 1200 cals per day.

I will no longer be eating less than 1200 calories per day, and thankfully I have not been eating at such a severe deficit for long so I haven't hurt myself.

I'm a 5' 0"" tall female so I don't burn that many calories in a day on days that I can't make it to the gym.

I'm on a diet rn aiming to lose 1.5 to 2 lbs per week which requires a deficit of 700-1000 calories per day. Im using semaglutide shots to curb my hunger since dieting is excruciating for me otherwise. (I'm hella food brained which is why I've struggled with my weight for the past few years)

It feels like every time I look up information about dieting it says not to eat less than 1300 calories per day for all women regardless of stature but this makes zero sense to me no matter how I look at it.

Like so long as I'm maintaining a deficit of 700-1000 cals per day I don't understand why it would be a problem??

Someone of my size probably needs less nutrients and macros than someone who's 5'5"" for example. So long as I eat nutritious food and aim for around 45 g of protein per day I just don't understand how it's dangerous.

If the 1300 calorie minimum thing is true, it would mean that it's impossible for a woman of my height to safely lose 2 lbs per week with a realistic and sustainable activity level.

By the way, I track everything I eat and use a fitness tracker to carefully make sure I'm getting enough of each macro nutrient per day. On days I walk around a lot and go to the gym I always eat more."

My question is, since I eat exactly how I did before i was diagnosed, so if it raised my blood sugar to the point that i am considered diabetic then why isn't it enough to normalize my blood sugar with the meds?"

For that time I’ve just figured it was some sort of VLC issue; I’ve been watching Netflix with a pretty rough wi-fi connection while on holiday, and I’ve noticed that similarly I’ll open the Netflix app after moving to another app, and the video will resume in a (very similar to VLC) terrible quality/with distortion that immediately resolves itself when there is a change in scenes - from two characters in a car to the car travelling down the road, for example.

My limited knowledge of video media suggests that this is a compression issue - (from my understanding) an entire scene can be compressed as the colours, lighting, movement is fairly constant, but the next scene - presenting an entire new image, must be… redrawn(?) from the ground up, with a fresh set of information.

Specifically, I have two questions:

1. If the cage has holes, how does the EMI field still fail to pass through these openings? Why does the electromagnetic energy remain confined to the surface of the metallic structure instead of propagating through the gaps?
2. When the EMI signal hits the metal cage, what happens to that energy? Is it reflected back toward the source, absorbed and dissipated within the material, or does it simply remain distributed on the surface of the chassis? In other words, how does the EMI “return” or resolve once it interacts with the cage?"

* Eating lots of food → stomach and metabolism issues instead of a stronger digestive system
* Lots of screen time → worse eyesight instead of stronger eyes

1) The gas from the combustion chamber can't go into the compressor because the air in the compressor is under high pressure.
2) The air in the compressor is under pressure because the compressor is being turned by a rotor, which is being driven by the turbine.
3) The turbine is turning because the expanding gas from the compression chamber flows out the back of the engine.

So our answer has brought us right back to the question we started off trying to answer.

Intuitively it seems like the gas pushing back (turning the turbine), and the gas pushing forward (backfeeding the compressor) should cancel out and stall the engine.

I suppose my question is how can the pressure from the combustion be sufficient to drive a turbine, that drives a compressor, that generates a pressure that overcomes the pressure of the combustion that started the whole process?

I feel like there is some critical principle of fluid dynamics I am missing."

I understand that a wall socket has 3 ports: (Hot/Positive, Neutral, and Ground). The intended path is electric current out from Hot to Neutral, with Ground being an optional fail safe to protect from short circuits/live chassis.

On a computer chip, say a Raspberry Pi Pico or a small control chip, there is usually a pin labelled for ""Voltage in"", which makes sense, but usually also ""Ground"", which the intended use is to complete the circuit for powering these devices (Vcc -> GND to power the chip). I understand a Voltage is a measurement of potential difference, so it is usually compared to a point of 0V (Ground). But why in a chip is ground the intended path of electricity?

Lastly, a battery. I understand that a battery has a positive and negative side, and the polarity (in laymans terms) attracts electrons from the negative to the positive side (and pushes from negative to positive. In a circuit, the intended path of electricity is from one end of the NEGATIVE to the POSITIVE.

Why do we call it ""(Hot)Positive/Neutral"", ""Voltage in(Positive)/Ground"", and ""Positive/Negative"" in these cases? Is it just terminology difference or do these three cases operate differently?"

Unless potential energy is somehow analyzing the entire universe to figure out if anything could maybe affect it in the the future but that is nonsensical too.

EDIT: Based on the comments, my understanding is that you can only measure potential energy with respect to a reference point, so you have to think of it as a system of things in a certain area where stuff is not added or removed or else the potential energy changes.

A buddy is the musical director for the NPR station and has confirmed that with the exception of ""hitting the play button"" for out-of-station syndicated and national broadcasts, as well as the 12am - 5am BBC Radio slot, the vast majority of their daily broadcast is manned in person and aired in real time.

I was looking into how to become a constable as i was interested in a more serious job or career and I'd enjoy what it sounds like to be a constable - just serving papers or evictions and such. Taking care of people's property and holding onto it.

But that doesn't mean i have to become a police officer,, right? I dont wanna like arrest ppl im not tryna be a cop. Just serve papers and do the shit it sounds like a constable is what im aiming for.

Kinda like that movie w seth Rogen pineapple express i think it was, his job lol - ik that's just a movie lol but still he served people their court papers and evictions and such.

But in the real world not in a stoner comedy movie, lol - how do i get that job? And its not the same thing as being a cop i don't have to become a cop.... Right??

All help is appreciated, thanks.

And this is kinda random but since on thw topic of police I've always been confused at this too - if a cop or cruiser is driving and they are from town X, say they're from Springfield and they're Springfield PD - if they are in Worcester County (prolly for court but idk why they'd be there. It happens.) - can they even arrest me or do anything if i commit a crime event right in front of them? Or can they even pull me over? If they're in worcester County but they're Springfield PD that's put of their jurisdiction.

Similarly, can a statie get you in trouble or arrest you or pull you over at all, in a different state that he's from? Like a Massachusetts statie pulling u over or arresting you in New Hampshire or in any other state, thats technically outside his jurisdiction. So.... I have always wondered this."

However when I used IBKR to buy 20 call options contracts of a share worth $10, my cash balance had a credit of >$2000 which is equivalent to simply buying all of the shares outright ($10 x 2000).

Edit: please let me elaborate on what I’m trying to say. I want to know how it would be if people are just paid some money in exchange for a service without it having to be taxed. For example I heard that in Dubai there is no income tax. Why is this not practiced in other countries?

During one of my lectures at university my professor introduced the concepts of impulse and kinetic energy to us. During the lecture he said that we can imagine the impulse as the ""amount of movement"" of an object.

I have tried doing the research myself but I somehow always land back at the same conclusion: that both kinetic energy and impulse describe the same thing.

I do understand that impulse is a vector and kinetic energy a scalar value. That both have different formulas and that kinetic energy scales quadratically with speed while impulse scales lineraly. And of course that energy is force times distance while impulse is force times time.

To me it looks like they should be interchangeable, as kinetic energy is also the ""amount of movement"" that an object posses, right? And if an object hits another object, which of these two is responsible for what?

The only somewhat decent explanation I have come up with is that the impulse describes the process of transferring energy from one object to another during a collision, but that doesn't seem quite right either.

I hope that someone here can maybe provide an example that finally makes it stick in my head, what exactly the difference is.

Thank you in advance!"

However those only have a single serial connector, with no extra power supply. I used to assume that the serial port has some kind of power pin, but outside of specific applications like retail systems, this actually isn't the case as I learned recently. If there is no dedicated power pin, what supplied power to a serial mouse?

Note: this is more of a curiosity than anything else. Modern mice of course use either PS2 or USB which both have a dedicated power pin, or Bluetooth, in which case they have an internal battery.

EDIT: People thought I was talking about PS/2, which again has a dedicated power pin. I was specifically talking about mice which used the even older RS-232 standard (conveyed via a 9-pin D-sub connector similar to VGA)."
