From my research I saw you need a gooseneck kettle, a paper filter, coffee grounds (maybe a grinder too), and a dripper. Also a glass ""carafe / server?""

I want to go buy these things and try it.

Generally, is this gooseneck kettle supposed to be placed on the stove to heat the water inside? I know people often use those things you put on a thing and press the button and it automatically heats it with energy but those often are made from plastic.

Is there a name for the glass thing it goes into, so I know to get the right one.

Thank you."

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1pq3t13/coffee_shop_says_2monthold_beans_are_at_peak,Coffee shop says 2monthold beans are at peak,"Ordered a 2 lb bag from an online coffee shop for the second time. First order was much fresher; this one arrived about 2 months post-roast. The site advertises freshly roasted, so I emailed them. This is part of their response:

 “I can understand that you were surprised at first that the roast was already two months old. However, this is not a quality defect in high-quality roasted coffee, but is often even advantageous. Here are a few reasons why your coffee is reaching its full potential right now:

Degassing: Freshly roasted beans still contain a lot of carbon dioxide (CO2). This must escape in the first 2 to 3 weeks after roasting. If the coffee were too young, the gas would hinder extraction during brewing and often result in a slightly metallic or unpleasant sour taste. After two months, this process is perfectly complete.

Aroma development: Similar to a good wine, many coffee varieties only develop their complex flavor profile after a certain resting period. The aromas settle and the mouthfeel becomes more harmonious.

Optimal storage: Since our bags are equipped with special aroma protection valves, the beans are protected from oxygen. In the unopened package, the freshness is almost completely preserved for many months.”

For context, I had the same coffee earlier and it tasted great. This batch is still fine, but noticeably flatter.

Thoughts?

Update, sorry for lots of text:
Wrote them an email:

Hi, Well, that’s certainly one way to use AI - I didn’t know it came with a gaslighting mode.

I understand degassing and valve bags. What this explanation doesn’t address is the simple fact that the same beans tasted noticeably better when they were fresher, and are now clearly flatter. That feels a lot more like normal staling than “reaching full potential.”
I’m not saying the coffee is defective — just that it’s hard to reconcile “freshly roasted” with beans that apparently peak months later.
Thank you for your business and the response. I’ll most likely order from somewhere else next time, but wanted to share the feedback.

Their reply:
Hello ,
thank you for your feedback and your opinion on the way we provide customer support. AI aside, freshly roasted beans are never ready to use straight away, and if you think they are perfect immediately after roasting, that is your personal perception. They are only optimal after at least 14 days—and another month is better than worse, otherwise we would not sell the beans.
It's a shame that you didn't find your coffee happiness with us, but we are aware that we cannot please everyone.
We wish you a Merry Christmas with your loved ones and thank you for your order and feedback."
https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1pq5ohz/filteronly_coffee_cart_economics,Filteronly coffee cart economics,"I've never seen a coffee cart that just does automatic batch filter coffee (UK based). I was wondering for high-traffic events/locations if a cart business selling relatively cheaper(?) coffee would be viable?

I know espresso/milk drinks are more attractive to a big chunk of consumers, but just having the simple coffee option of black and white coffee (sugar/sweeteners could be asked for or self-serve) could be fine or even appealing to some.

McDonalds had an [ad campaign ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wVjB2BAWXXM)suggesting their coffee options as an affordable and ""no-nonesense"" alternative to other places serving coffee, which I think shows there's a marketing angle such a coffee cart could tap into. That's not to say the ""just coffee"" sentiment isn't a bit wank a lot of the time lol.

But generally this could be appealing to people who want coffee quick and more affordable. I'm assuming it'll be quicker and more affordable because having batch coffee ready (justified by a hypotheticsl constant flow of coffee sales at least) should mean an easy job serving customers, and the real daily concern is operating/maintaining the automatic dripper(s), as well as setup/etc..

I feel like I'm missing something though. Potential big issues:

* Rent/fee costs of being in a high-traffic area/situation, which is necessitated to having relatively cheaper coffee, would be killer.
* Even though it could be relatively cheaper than espresso businesses, it'd still need to cost something higher than what a consumer would think say instant coffee should be, who don't understand and appreciate what it takes to have good drip coffee. On the flip side, making espresso-based drinks is a show and dance which can easily communicate that the coffee is somehow special to people.

Assuming one masters the dripper and really hones in on the flavour through bean sourcing and method calibration, I was thinking this ironically this could lead to great, consistent coffee that beats half-baked complicated espresso-based businesses operated by the coffee-indifferent, which understandably seems to be the norm outside of speciality coffee shops. Was thinking it could be a rewarding sole trader business... not that I'm looking to pivot anytime soon! Possibly just not viable, and in any case I don't imagine an insane money maker.

Has anyone else thought about this before? I'd be really curious to hear your opinions!"

I use a basic pourover system and typically buy pre-ground coffee from local or regional roasters and am generally satisfied with the results. I do sometimes buy whole beans instead and so I have a manual grinder for those occasions, however when I grind my own beans the result is always sour or astringent. I've seen that poor quality grinders can create dust which apparently heightens astringency, though the grinder I have is pretty highly rated for the price (it is pretty cheap as far as grinders go at \~$70).
I typically wet the grounds and allow 30sec-1min for outgassing afterwards before brewing. What am I doing wrong? Should I just be increasing the coarseness of the grind? Any tips/solutions? TIA"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1pmzk5m/trying_to_understand_what_im_doing,Trying to understand what im doing,"So I have considered myself a coffee snob...that is until I came to this sub and see how much I was misunderstanding coffee and misinterpreting my preferences.

I prefer dark roast which I grind by hand daily- 35 grams for a 16 oz cup. I brew using just boiled water with a French press and the grind is fine enough that I usually do not finish the last sip due to the powder settled at the bottom. The press can be tough to lower initially due to the fineness of the grind, but it is not so fine that I can't press the grounds into a dry puck at the bottom. I garnish with a dollop of honey and a splash of 1/2&1/2.

I think I'm somewhat refined in my process and I can make a consistent, strong flavored, smooth brew. I can tell stale beans by smell and taste. I know that whatever I like is what I like and that's all there is to it, but what does this say about my coffee preferences? Am I an ignorant prole?

When I have had coffee at specialty brewers I have been unimpressed. I wish I had a true snob to help me understand what I am experiencing, if the single origin pour over is truly being done to its potential or if what I've had is expensive and poorly done but accepted by other ignorant folks because of expectation.

Anyhow, I appreciate any insight."

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1pkyrum/have_you_ever_disliked_a_bag_of_beans_so_much_its,Have you ever disliked a bag of beans so much its,"For a long time I’ve been a huge fan of dark roasts. I love thick, oily, earthy cups. I have been pretty much exclusively buying Sumatran dark roasts for years now. But as I’ve been learning more about coffee I’ve felt like I should experiment a bit more so I got a different dark roast. It smelled good, it was freshly roasted by a well regarded local shop, everything indicated I’d like it.

I absolutely hate it. I’ve been playing with my process some (aeropress) but no matter what, all I can think when I taste it black is “oh this is why coffee people hate on dark roasts.” The only notes I get are bitterness, ash and wood. If I’m being charitable maybe it tastes like someone is yelling “chocolate” in the next room. I’m sure that there’s something I could do to improve it, but ultimately I just don’t like the flavors that are there.

The fact that it forces me to add milk and sugar just to make it palatable is really making me think that everyone who says dark roasts are too bitter are right. I’m probably not going to stop buying my favorite Sumatran coffee, but I think I need to open my mind to lighter roasts. I’m thinking I need to do a tasting with a few different types of beans and start branching out.

Anyone else have a similar experience? Am I just being too dramatic about this particular batch?"

I have just compared two burrs from the 1zpresso k-ultra grinders, and found that they are both different. This has disturbed and annoyed me.

I have done my best to take adequate pictures showing the more obvious differences between them.

Could anybody explain why they might be different? Different generations or just manufacturing differences?.. And also explain which burr might be more ideal compared to the other?

The burr on the right seems to have longer cutting teeth at the bottom. The burr on the left has a larger area without serrations at the top...

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1phrqqz/practical_ro_water_method,Practical ro water method,"I’m looking for a better, easier way to build my brewing water from RO. What’s your day to day process like?

I followed the guide from barista hustle. But I find it quite impractical to maintain multiple 1 liter bottles (buffer and hard) and have to measure out 20-60 grams of each for every brew.

My made up solution was to combine both bicarb and epsom and dissolved into a mason jar of RO at 10x the concentration. Then at time of brewing add 10 ml from a syringe of my concentrate per liter. However, after a few days the minerals fall out of solution crystallized and make a mess in the glass, making it hard to know what minerals are actually making it into my brewing water.

Do you have a practical method? I like the third wave concept of just dumping in a pre measured packet, but I’m cheap and want to be able to do that with my minerals on my own.  Maybe a super tiny spoon that measure out a half a gram or so of my bicarb and epsom mix?

It’s gotta be easy, cheap, and daily repeatable.

EDIT:  Thanks for some thoughts. Aramse led me to some new resources that have helped modify my thinking on this. Following the ideas below my new method will be:
Concentrate = 8g Epsom salt, 3.8 baking soda 189ml water.
Add 4 mls to a liter of RO to make brewing water.
Store the concentrate in the fridge, this may be a key detail.

I’m interested to get some of the other minerals to try out too.

\-Inverted

\-Medium Coarse grind (lately finer)

\-15g C / 250g h2o

\-205F

\-Double paper filter

\-2:00 +/- 15s based on taste

New technique I'm trying:

\-50g bloom, 30s, swirl, making sure full saturation

\-Pour remaining 200g h2o.

\-Slow compression at 2:00 into server.

The sweetness, the body, the full flavor of the coffees are coming through.  It's an incredible difference in taste.  My normal technique, I was getting 8/10, 7/10 cups regularly.

I've tried my new method a half dozen times and it's just so much better I don't see myself changing how I do Aeropress.

We still have Friday left. I’ve been in the coffee world for many years, but I still have doubts about this topic. If I use water that has already been boiled before, does it affect the taste of the coffee? Does it affect the flavor of the cup?

I’ve been searching to see if there’s any scientific indication or any research where someone gave a clear and definitive answer  yes or no.

For example, just to make things clearer: I currently use Lotus drops . I put 900 ml of water in the kettle, and during one brewing session, I might boil the same water twice. While I prepare my setup and everything, the temperature drops, so I boil it again to bring it up to temperature. I always brew at 95°C because I mostly work with light roasts.

The 900 ml usually gives me about two cups, so we can say during those two cups the water might be boiled 4 or 5 times. So I’m wondering, does this actually have an effect? Because usually, if the water gets boiled more than twice, the taste of the cup starts to change — but I don’t know if I’m imagining it or if someone else experiences the same thing.

So I’m looking for a real answer, guys. Especially about this topic. And I hope if anyone has solid knowledge about this, they can help me out."

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1paol5k/moka_pot_paper_filter_not_worth_the_hype,Moka pot paper filter not worth the hype,"First a bit of info, I have:

Bialetti 2cup

Porlex mini II grinder

I usually grind at about 750μm (coarse, I know)

I mostly enjoy dark roasts since I have a dislike for acidic taste in coffee. I also mostly drink cappuccino.

Anyways. I've recently bought some aeropress paper filters to see if adding one to a moka pot is actually worth the hype and I've been severely unimpressed. I've brewed 8 cups of coffee in one morning for testing, used a different grind size setting for each, and the filter made all of them a lot worse. Except for no sediment in the final cup, there was no benefit - to me. The filter made all of the brews much more acidic and removed all the nuanced taste notes. Only on a pretty coarse grind (650μm) my mid-dark Peru finally had some of the nuttiness come through. And in none of the tests my natural mid roast Ethiopia had its fruitiness show up. Both roasts got extremely unpleasantly acidic at any setting I tried, between 400μm-750μm. I'm sure the paper just sucks in some of the natural oils or something, completely skewing the final taste of the coffee.

So for me, absolutely no good. I'm thinking about getting a metal filter and just pouring the finished coffee over it to get rid of the particles."

The beans look perfectly fine from the outside. No weird smell, no moisture, no visible mold on the surface. But I cracked open a single bean that had a tiny worm hole, and the inside looked like this...

So now I’m trying to understand: Is this kind of internal mold common in worm-damaged beans? In specialty coffee, is this considered acceptable as a rare defect?If you find one like this, do you usually just toss the bean, return the bag, or not worry about it?

I’m not trying to start a panic or blame the roaster . More curious how often people see this in “specialty” beans and how you judge if it’s still safe/normal

The coffee they typically make is already pretty weak, my wife compares it more to tea than coffee. We typically volunteer to make coffee over the holiday. But I discovered this morning after getting beaten to the punch that they apparently make multiple large pots with the same grounds. They use about 5 tablespoons of ground coffee for about 10 cups, already pretty weak, and then once the first pot is done, they add a light dusting of grounds to the old and rerun. Apparently they do this for 3-4 pots of coffee over the course of a day.

I’m in the process of opening a small neighborhood café and I thought I had my entire equipment list sorted out… except for the grinder…

Initially, I had my eyes on the Fiorenzato AllGround Sense, mainly because of the very positive reviews I’ve seen here on Reddit. However, I recently noticed a few other contenders that made me rethink things:
	•	Mahlkönig E64 WS – I’m honestly in love with the E65S GBW, which all my café-owner friends are using, so this feels like the closest (and slightly saner) option.
	•	Mazzer Mini G – I’ve heard so many people say that Mazzer is basically the god of grinders, but my only hands-on experience so far has been with the Philos.

For the espresso machine, I’ll be going with a La Marzocco Linea Mini R, paired with an Acaia Lunar, using a brew-by-weight workflow. This setup should comfortably handle more back-to-back shots than I realistically can pull, while costing less than half of a Linea PB ABR, which would essentially do the same job for my use case.

That said, I do hope the grinder I choose will also hold up well on busier days, or if the café ends up having moments that feel more like a traditional commercial-volume environment.

I’d really appreciate any real-world feedback or opinions on these grinders, especially in a low-volume specialty café environment. Reliability, consistency, and workflow matter more to me than absolute peak throughput.

Thanks in advance 🙏"

AFAIK both grinders are totally made out of metal, have little retention and every single time I've had retention it's out by the next grind. On top of it, the oils of the coffee should dissolve the remaining spice oils.

It also doesn't make sense to me to have an entire grinder for spices, because if it ruins coffee, it would also ruin other spices you pass through there if you decided to mix any of them up.

So, does anybody have any actual experience?

I’ve been learning about coffee and wanted to ask. How relevant is the Agtron score when it comes to telling the roast level of your beans?

Does it really add value, or is it not that important? I imagine an experienced roaster can tell a lot just by looking at the beans and probably get more info at a glance. But overall, what’s your experience.

* Does the score actually matter?
* Also, does knowing the Agtron score help with quality assurance or other tests?
* Would knowing the Agtron score help you decide the temperature of your brew, or the size of your grind settings? (at least as an initial configuration for a new bag)
* Do you see value for home brewers?

Update: thank you for your answers.
The reason I am asking this is to know if it would be worth/valuable to have an alternative without having to spend thousands on the real thing (at least as an entry point for QA when you roast/brew) so you can evaluate if buying a device would be worth. I’ve seen some devices in Amazon, but I am thinking about using something different for a small project."
https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1p5tbgn/gutted_my_fellow_customer_support_anyone_else,Gutted my fellow customer support anyone else,"Hi Coffee Folks!

Just needed to have a moan for a minute because I'm honestly fairly annoyed right now.

Back in 2021, I decided to treat myself and bought a load of Fellow gear. I got the Ode grinder, the canisters, and **two** kettles (a Stagg and a Corvo). I spent serious money (\~$400 USD just for the kettles and approx $900 total!) thinking that ""premium"" meant they would actually last the distance.

Unfortunately, they didn't.

* **Base #1** packed it in about a year ago. Completely stopped working. I didn't cause a massive issue for me then, as I just shared the one working base between the two kettles.
* **Base #2** died completely two weeks ago. It has the exact same issue as the first base.

So now I have two beautiful, expensive kettles that are totally useless.

I know electronics don't last forever, but less than 3-4 years for this price? That feels fairly short to me. Since both bases failed in the exact same way, it really seems like a hardware fault rather than just bad luck.

The worst part is the customer service. I contacted Fellow, and they told me it wasn't their problem and to talk to the European shop. When I contacted the shop, they just told me the warranty had expired, and they couldn't do anything for me.

So now I'm stuck with no help from either of them.

I just want to flag this to anyone thinking of spoiling themselves on Fellow gear, as I will never again buy a product of theirs again after this experience and want others to be aware of their aftercare support.

**TL;DR:** Bought 2 Fellow kettles in 2021, and now both bases are dead. Support wouldn't help because the warranty is up. Gutted given the high price.

Cheers."

I'm no coffee afficionado or connossieur, but I find it really weird that almost nowhere but the most specialist independent coffee shops offers *any* kind of choice in the coffee they serve.

My partner and I both really dislike acidic, citrusy coffee and much prefer a darker, more chocolatey roast. She drinks it black so really tastes it and in particular finds that it gets increasingly unpalatable as it cools; I have milk and a tangy coffee definitely doesn't work well with that. As I see it, this is the fundamental divide in coffee flavour profiles, and the fact that it isn't more common to at least be offered a choice between those two seems like a restaurant just having *wine*, with no choice even between red or white. And I swear there are probably more restaurants that have a *water* sommelier than offer you a choice even between two roasts for your after-dinner coffee. Furthermore, there is no advertisement of an establishment's chosen style, so you have to just go and try it for yourself, often leading to an unsatisfying morning coffee when you're away from home.

If a place is using an espresso machine they can put whatever coffee is needed in for each brew, so all that would be required is for a 2nd grinder, which doesn't seem like too much of a burden to be able to get customers a lot closer to drinking the coffee they enjoy.

As I said, I'm not even a coffee enthusiast and this irritates me; is this something that others find strange or irritating? Is there maybe a reason why almost no businesses cater to what I have to assume is not a particularly obscure consumer desire?"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1p38old/a_love_letter_to_oil,A love letter to oil,"During a brief stint in Malaysia, I was lucky enough to taste a particularly rare bean, an anaerobic, yeast-inoculated Liberica. The experience was transcendent for me, specifically due to the disbelief that fell over me... How can a coffee have that much body? A body so strong and so intense that it became jammy, sticky in my mouth - at one point I questioned if this flavour could ever end - it couldn't, right? given its surreal intensity - but luckily, it landed with an extraordinarily clean finish.

Flavour notes aside, I knew immediately this was the type of coffee I was after: intense, rich, sticky, vibrant, fruity, yet with a civilised, clean finish. I got talking to the man who brewed me this fine drink. He revealed he had simply combined cupping technique with a traditional kopi socks: In a French press, he gently bloomed and poured,then let this brew for a long time, broke the crust, let it settle, then cloth-filtered what was left atop the settled bed. I feared this; it's high-contact time, it's coarse grind, and the lack of paper filters. I feared how it caused the third wave within me to turn in its grave.

I am aware that loud groups have advocated for metal filters and the beauty of actually retaining the oils in the brew. But often the inconsistency with these brewers, and the sedimentation that results from them, is less than desirable. But this technique, combined with unimodal burrs, has yielded some of the best cups I've ever brewed. I am a strong advocate for this new age of funk and fruit, the antithesis to the floral, washed Ethiopian V60 of yesterday, but perhaps we are not tailoring brewing enough to this new style. I believe heads will only truly be blown away if we give these fermented/natural/cofermented beans the oils they need to explode.

The modern obsessions - clarity and complexity - do not lend themselves to mindblowing coffee, but rather to cupped poetry. Yes, I can taste and appreciate the rare florals that hang above that washed Ethiopian. Florals, which would never have come to the forefront without paper filtering and high-clarity processing. But not all beans are built for this. The low-altitude, hyper-fermented, natural, and fruity beans do not lend themselves to this method and are thus largely dismissed as low-end beans. Taking clarity off her pedestal to crown intrigue and intensity as joint rulers could add a wholly new colour to the global coffee palette.

Additionally, more focus and acknowledgment should be placed on SEA’s third wave. An area of the world with arguably a richer coffee history than many esteemed coffee capitals (Trieste, Melbourne, London, Copenhagen), and one that, more importantly, has domestic production. There is something truly special about seeing cafes in Vietnam and Malaysia brewing coffee with beans from nearby. A true connection between farm and cup that we in the West can only pretend to achieve. But we can do better, historic global brewers such as the phin filter, kopi sock, jebena, and cezve can make incredible coffee. Yet, they have not had the same fine lens applied to them that the third wave has dished out to espresso, bypass filters, and immersion paper filters.

This post primarily stands as a call to the people of Reddit: try making some oily, funky coffee! But I also want to highlight something more profound... I think that when looking for the next direction for the industry to go, we must no longer solely highlight the terroir of the bean through processing and roasting, but also by using traditional techniques that create truly unique coffees that reflect the people of the area, not just the soil.

In an effort to make this piece enjoyable to read, I have used very poetic language. I hope this makes it more interesting and not just more pretentious. But if you fall into the latter opinion, I am sorry, I know, etc.

Edit:

A few people have been asking for a more precise recipe rather than a poem, so here it is:

26g per cup - 350g water (you get out what you get out) Course grind, but the grind is variable as you basically want it as fine as possible with it still forming a crust and not clouding the liquid. This depends on bean CO2, roast, and a million other things. So aim for course/ course medium and dial it in. I do this all in a French press simply because its what I have on hand. But any large - straight walled vessel with a spout will work. Preheat the vessel.

\- Bloom: Just off the boil (95 degrees) \~60g of water in a super gentle pour that evenly saturates grounds. You are not aiming for agitation at any point in this brew, as to preserve aromatics.

\- after 30s (dont over bloom otherwise you get no crust) pour a very slow and steady steam up to 360g, I am still debating over central pour and circling, the most essential part though is that after your done, there is crust. Put a lid on

\- 7 minute steep, then break crust super gently with a spoon so it settles, on top of this will be some foam and fines, skim them off with then spoon. Put lid back on

\- 9 minutes in decant through a cloth filter gently. You shouldn't really pour off any grounds, but the filter is a nice failsafe for any fines.

If you do not have a cloth filter, just using the metal of a French press works well enough if you are super gentle. Also the cup is better after a little cooling (3 mins or so)

I know its not a massive revelation itself. But this is just one of many things I am experimenting with to reintroduce oils to my coffee. I am also working on phin filter recipes, and have been enjoying some very Malaysian, dark fried Liberica (they fry it in margarine and sugar). The latter however, requires milk and sugar to balance, but is super interesting."

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1p346pc/arrogant_service_they_told_me_to_sift_my_own,Arrogant service they told me to sift my own,"I purchased 1kg of Guatemala Antigua directly from Redber's website (Order #378085), specifically hoping to avoid the stale coffee issues I experienced with other sellers on Amazon. I even emailed them beforehand to ensure freshness.

What I received was a bag full of beans mixed with an excessive amount of **chaff (silverskin/husks)**. The coffee tasted extremely bitter, woody, and papery—completely undrinkable.

When I contacted their customer service with photos of the chaff-filled grounds, their response was absolutely shocking and condescending.

1. **They lectured me:** Instead of addressing the quality issue, they tried to ""educate"" me on the fact that they are not Amazon, completely missing the point of my previous email context.
2. **They admitted the defect:** They explicitly admitted in writing that the chaff adds a *""papery or woody flavour""* to the coffee.
3. **THE INSULT:** Their solution? They told me to **""sift or shake the grounds""** myself to remove the chaff!

I paid for roasted coffee beans, not a ""Do It Yourself"" kit. Telling a customer to manually sift 1kg of coffee at home to get rid of your production mess is the most unprofessional advice I have ever heard from a roaster.

If you want to buy coffee and then spend hours sifting it like you are mining for gold just to make it drinkable, go ahead. Otherwise, stay away.

**Pros:** None. **Cons:** Arrogant support, poor quality control, woody taste.

The Daily Question Thread would be a good place to start, and check out what is on the Front Page and jump in on some discussions. Please maintain a high ratio of general /r/Coffee participation to posts in this thread.

- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.

- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

- No crowdfunding campaigns (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc). Do not promote a business or product that does not exist yet. Do not bait people to ask about your campaign. Do not use this thread to survey /r/Coffee members or gauge interest in a business idea you have.

- Please do not promote affiliate/referral programs here, and do not post referral links in this thread.

- This thread is not a place for private parties to sell gear. /r/coffeeswap is the place for private party gear transactions.

- Top-level comments in this thread must be listings of deals. Please do not comment asking for deals in your area or the like.

- More rules may be added as needed. If you're not sure whether or not whatever you're posting is acceptable, message the mods and ask! And please, ask for permission first rather than forgiveness later."

I own a small coffee shop — it’s about 60 square meters with 6 tables. We’ve been open for a little over a year now. I’ve tried running different campaigns and promotions, but none of them really brought consistent results.

In the last two months, the business has just been breaking even — not losing money, but not really growing either.

At this point, I’m not sure what strategy to apply next. Should I focus more on marketing, the menu, customer experience, or something else entirely?

Would really appreciate hearing from other coffee shop owners or anyone with experience in small hospitality businesses. What worked for you when things felt stuck?"

My boyfriend drinks pour over coffee and uses a Melita ceramic filter, but this isnt ideal (chips, fragile etc).
Stainless steel is not ideal for him (imparts a metallic taste to the coffee apparently?).
He mentioned once wanting to try a enamel coffee filter but couldnt find any to buy (we're in the EU).

I would like to buy one for him as a gift, but I'm finding almost no options online or in stores.
Does anyone know where to source one? Like particular brands or stores, or alternatives.

Conversely, beans that are more or less of objectively good quality tend to taste great even after the brew gets cold.

This is NOT the sole criterion by which I judge my brews. It’s just an interesting thing I’ve noticed.

Is this a thing? Am I too uneducated to know that this is common knowledge? Am I completely off base? Should I stop drinking coffee, move to the mountains, and retire in shame?

I’m very curious to hear what my fellow enthusiasts think."

I will not bore you with details but a long-term and sustainable clinic in East Africa that provides medical care for a modest fee to the local rural community has been funded by donations for the past 13 years. They are looking to transition into a self sustainable model.
They tried with local artisanal products and is it not viable. Basically, if those can be made in China for two cents, there is absolutely no way they can compete in any of western markets with artisan products no matter the quality and real handmade products.

But they - the local folks - can certainly grow coffee. The problem is nobody among the clinic staff knows anything about growing and selling coffee because we are all medical professionals 😆😂 so I read up on the supply chain and how it’s all sold in pallets and then split into bags and basically it seems like the only people who make money are Starbucks?

Anyway, wondering if anybody can weigh in on how to go about this to create a self sustainable model or if it’s yet another way where the people who grow the coffee are just taken advantage of. Many thanks!"

But we are open to getting away from the Nespresso in favor of a good alternative.

On the weekends I especially love a good pour over and we use a Chemex. It makes amazing coffee that I love to drink but the time and attention we have to give it on busy mornings is a bit challenging.

All things considered is the Fellows Aiden giving similar flavor profiles to the Chemex but quicker, more convenient to use? I also think I like other features such as being able to make various quantities, the timer, the de-scaling reminder, etc.

Then when we want something espresso related we could use an aeropress.

Main issue is that due to my induction stove. it doesn't seem to heat it all too well, the stove settings range from 1-9, and on 6 it refuses to pull the coffee through, but at 7 it already sputters out and becomes more bitter than id like it to be. I don't know how exactly this could be solved, Apparently if you put a pan under the pot it works better on induction stoves, even though I specifically bought this specific pot because of its stainless steel base so it works on induction. Anyone got any experience or tricks on how to make it work better?

I also kind of struggle with the filter funnel, I just finished pouring myself a cup, but getting the filter funnel out without burning myself on the water reservoir is nigh impossible. I ended up scooping out a bit of the grounds with a spoon so I can place a finger inside the funnel and pull it out that way, but maybe there's a better method?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1oi8cv9/heat_retention_of_enamel_vs_ceramic_cups,Heat retention of enamel vs ceramic cups,"I was wondering how well different cups retain heat. When searching for answers as to how a regular enamel cup compares to a standard ceramic mug, I found no good results, however, most people were saying that ceramic cups definitely retain heat better than enamel.

This makes a lot of sense. I imagine an enamel cup will feel hotter to touch than a ceramic one, but I was also very sceptical, so I made my own experiment.

My conclusion: If you do not preheat your cup, then an enamel cup might be better than a ceramic mug at retaining heat if you drink your coffee in <8 minutes.

# Procedure

I started with a standard enamel cup and a standard ceramic mug, both at room temperature and placed on cork disks.

I poured 200g of boiling water into both, and then proceeded to measure the temperature with a precise digital thermometer in one minute intervals. Since I only have one kettle, I poured water into the ceramic cup first, then the enamel.

On the minute I measured the temperature of the water in the ceramic first and then the enamel one (to account for the initial pouring delay. Measuring took at least 10 seconds to stabilise and note down.

# Results

As I suspected, the initial temperature is quite a bit higher in the enamel cup compared to the ceramic one. This is probably because of the large weight difference. An enamel cup is extremely light compared to a ceramic mug.
However, I found it surprising that the enamel cup was hotter for a whole 8 minutes, after which, unsurprisingly, the better heat retention of the ceramic cup caught up to the initial difference.

Problems:
Perhaps placing the cups on cork is a bigger benefit to the enamel cup than the ceramic one, since the enamel might loose heat faster through the table than the ceramic one? Perhaps, but some people use coasters that could have similar effect.
The measuring is prone to error. Each measurement takes time and is difficult to do 100% consistently. How long am I measuring? Perhaps the water in the middle of the cup is hotter than the edge? and so on.

We started by using grind setting at 3 and about half the dial for quantity at the beginning, and the pressure gauge was in perfect range. A few days later. Without changing anything, the pressure dropped. So I tried to increase a bit the quantity, helped a bit. Every day I had to adjust something. Now I set the grind setting at 1 and the quantity at a quarter of the dial. If I put the quantity dial at half, it overfill a lot. If I put it back to the same setting we had at the beginning (grind at 3 and quantity at half), we throw away alot of coffee since it overfill a and the pressure gauge literally moved about 5% max.

Recently we have noticed there is leaking around the portafilter when brewing.  I bought a few gasket rings to replace and made sure it was flush and everything installed correctly.  It still leaks at the back end of the portafilter, during mid brew and a few minutes afterwards.

I’ve compared the new gasket rings to the stock one and it’s essentially the same (aftermarket)

I have checked to make sure there were no cracks in the gasket apparatus. I adjusted my grinds multiple times with no success.

I run a de-scale and clean the coffee outlet monthly.

Anyone have any thoughts on how to troubleshoot?

So as the title suggests. I locked the burrs of my zp6 within minutes of starting to play with it. I knew it was a thing, but I wanted to find the actual 0 (like I do with literally every other hand grinder I've ever used - C2, Q air, K6) It's so strange because I applied so little force while turning it... And still it happened.

So I went on reddit and someone said rotate the outer burrs (the ring above the catch cup threading) and it should release it. It kinda helped and I managed to eventually unlock the darn thing.. Anyway when I recalibrated it according to 1zpresso's instructions, I felt that the burrs were touching only on some parts of the turn, and not all the way through... So that made me wonder if I fucked the alignment somehow. And when I read the manual, I saw that disassembling the outer burrs is not to be done..

So here's a post with a video of me trying to show the spinning of the burrs. Just looking at it seemed perfect, but upon zooming in, I noticed some level of wobble when turning the burrs...

Having travelled a lot in Europe, I see a pretty clear divide between the (mainly Northern) countries that normally serve coffee in a big cup and the (mainly Southern and Eastern) that normally give you a small cup. I'm not talking about Starbucks or any fancy chains and I'm not talking about typical touristy places. I'm talking about what a native of that country, speaking his native language, will get if he or she asks for 'a coffee (please)' in an ordinary cafe or bar in an ordinary non-touristy town. Alternatively, what cups you or I would see most people using if we sat in that cafe. I have made a mental map, which is not quite complete. Maybe someone can help me complete it. The big cup countries I'm sure about are: the Scandinavian countries, UK, Germany, the Netherlands and Austria. The small cup countries I'm sure about are: France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Hungary, Slovakia, Ukraine, Serbia, North Macedonia, Turkey. Probably also all the other Balkan countries. The countries I am not sure about are: the Baltic states, Poland, European Russia, Belgium (maybe small cups in the French-speaking part?), Luxembourg. Can you fill me in on any of those?"

I had thought that my preference was for thicker shots with more body, but I can't pick up any notes or distinct flavours anymore - just a general medium-dark roast average coffee flavour. I know that there's supposed to be a difference but I never thought it'd be this much. I basically only drink milk coffee.

Do I just switch back to the ssp burrs? Has anyone else had this same experience, as I'm enjoying the thicker shots but the trade off for muted flavours is really off-putting?"

I grind my beans using a standard oxo blade grinder that I got for $15 or something. It’s better than the pre-ground coffee I was buying.

I’ve had a few people lately tell me I need to upgrade to a burr grinder. I understand the logic behind them (more even particles, beans are ground rather than cut by blades, yada yada) but are they that much better in the end?

If it’s REALLY something I should look into, can anyone recommend one that would accommodate a small amount of beans at a time? I don’t want a big hopper to deal with as I’m generally drinking something different every morning

Edit: I’m starting with a cheaper grinder from the Greater Goods brand (good reviews and it’s being bought for me so I can’t complain) eventually I will get the baratza encore more than likely.

I can’t believe how many of you want me to hand grind coffee beans. I get it, but I’m not about that life at 5AM"

I wasn't super sure how to look for a thread about this topic, so I'm sorry if one already exists!

The espresso machine I work with is a La Marzocco Linea PB 4 grouphead. We use the original La Marzocco portafilters with La Marzocco 18g ""double shot"". We use 17g of espresso with a 1:2 coffee ratio, so our ""double"" espresso shots are 34g in weight.

If you go online and look up the correct way to make a cappuccino, you'll see a whole bunch of stuff about it needing to be 1 part espresso, 1 part steamed milk, and 1 part foam. If we were to do this with our 34g espresso shots, which seem to be somewhere about 40ml-50ml depending on the crema and whatnot, assuming that that 1:1:1 ratio is based on the volume of the ingredients and not the weight, you would end up with a cappuccino that's 120ml-150ml, which would be anywhere from 4 to 5 fl oz. This seems contrary to the 5-6oz that is echoed by lots of different places online. The biggest part I suppose, I'm confused about is, if a ""double shot"" portafilter basket can only result in enough espresso for a 4-5 ounce cappuccino, how on earth could anyone make a cappuccino with a single shot? Are there larger portafilter baskets out there that allow the use of more grounds, thus a larger volume of espresso per one shot? Do my shots not have nearly as much crema as they should? (We almost exclusively use medium-light roasts.) Are we supposed to be using two of our 34-oz shots of espresso for one cappuccino??

I hope I articulated the question correctly! Hopefully, someone can help me understand whatever it is that I seem to be missing or possibly misunderstanding.

Thanks in advance!"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1ntr9mx/new_to_coffee_importexport_sales_how_should_i,New to coffee importexport sales how should i,"Hey Reddit,

I’ve always wanted to get into the coffee import/export business, and I figured the best way to learn the ropes is to actually work alongside people already in the game. I've moved to the EU and saw a great opportunity to drive imports from Ethiopia.

Fast forward: I connected with a coffee exporting company and made a verbal deal to come on as their first-ever sales rep. They haven’t pushed for an official agreement yet (since it’s new for them too), but I went ahead and drafted a Letter of Intent with some terms/conditions I’d like to see in place.

Here’s where I need advice:

What are the must-have clauses in an agreement like this?

Any red flags I should be wary of when working with the company or clients?

On compensation: they initially suggested an employment contract with monthly pay, but I feel that could be a burden if I don’t make sales right away. I’m leaning toward a commission-based structure where my income is tied to performance.

For those with experience in sales/import/export - what’s a reasonable commission percentage range I should be negotiating for in this industry?

Any tips, lessons learned, or things you wish you’d known starting out would be hugely appreciated!

TL;DR: Landed first coffee export sales rep role - need advice on contract terms & fair commission %."

Do you think I'll like coffee 10x more to justify the price? Right now, I'm very happy with my coffee, but, the one thing I would change is this acidic after taste I'm getting. I'm going to try grinding a little less fine and seeing if that helps (it goes from 0-40, 0 being fine, 40 being course.

In a perfect world this would include any other things necessary to it like beans and what not but i’m willing to spend the money if it ensures a quality machine.

I signed up for the single box of coffee with no subscription involved.

However, it still added me to an $80 subscription. Upon seeing the transaction I attempted to cancel the subscription yesterday and after taking me through a couple of loopholes it seemed to have worked. Only for me to still be subscribed today! I once again cancelled the subscription (which required bouncing around multiple attempts to stop me) and then talked to an agent who initially offered me a 25% off discount and then allowed my cancellation.

Just in the process today I went through 5 pages of cancellation and then a 20 min chat with the agent. Any positive notes I might have about the coffee itself have all been lost on the incredibly dark patterns being used to prevent subscribers from cancelling.

The only way to incentivize companies from not making cancellation hard is to boycott ones who do."

I followed the standard recipes online (1:1:1 ratio of heavy whipping cream, milk, pumpkin puree + pumpkin spice and vanilla/sweetener)

First time I did a test batch, it clearly separated. I knew right then and there that I overmixed/frothed too long. 2nd batch was fine, but I did an advanced batch to use the next morning. When I put it in my CB during breakfast, it had also separated and I was thinking maybe it separated/the milk fats solidified because my fridge was very cold.

So now, I make fresh cold foam every single time. I would froth it in just a short time on low speed, just enough for it to expand a little in volume. I know I was successful because everytime I woukd try it first and check if it separated. The 1st time was okay. Then the next 2 tries, when I pout it over my CB and mix it to drink, I have had the unpleasant experience of drinking solid milk fats 😅 I don't know what's wrong anymore.

Is it because the initial contact of the foam on my drink with lots of ice shocks the foam and makes the milk fats solidify? Or are my ingredients wrong? Should I not use a heavy whipping cream/nonfat milk combo?

Help! Haha I hate drinking milk fats. The coffee tastes great but it's like drinking soft mashed food bits with my coffee 🥲"

Maybe try pour over someday. No plans to go down the espresso hole (haha, famous last words?).

I have a cheapo manual grinder and for awhile it seemed ok (I was ignorant and I'm still trying to perfect my coffee). I use medium roast and was grinding coarse.

Then I saw the James Hoffmann video and tried a finer grind, but couldn't get it to taste right at all. I did notice there were a lot more fines and thought maybe that's what messed it up for me? I read that a good grinder would fix that problem. But I read someone else say that it doesn't matter that much for French Press. Especially at a coarser grind.

So I clearly need some advice.

If I need a better grinder, I'm considering something like a Timemore C2, but would possibly move up to the Kingrinder k6 if you think it would make much difference.

Update: Thanks for all the feedback. I just snagged a Timemore C3S on a flash sale, $65. Ever learning, glad I found this community!"

I'm a disabled person afflicted with something that makes me very physically weak. I just got myself a Sage Bambino Plus and i found out that it's impossible for me to use by myself.

The main issue is locking in the portafilter into the machine. It just requires way more strength than i can muster. Here are the conditions under which I've tried it...

1. I used the portafilter shipped with the machine. I've also used the provided non pressurized basket already slotted in.
2. There was no coffee inside it
3. The machine was completely unplugged and didn't run even once yet

So since this isn't something i can just look up, can you guys recommend other machines that would require less (or more likely, little to no) strength to lock the portafilter in? Or maybe there's something else i could try to fix my issue? I'd be glad for anything really, since I'm kinda stuck like this

EDIT:
I've tried it without the basket, and it was quite easy. But obviously i can't do that so."

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1nn4bje/oxo_grinder_wont_grind_coffee_but_will_grind,Oxo grinder wont grind coffee but will grind,"I’m wondering if anyone has any suggestion. As the title above suggests, I have an OXO grinder that’s just under 2 years old. It gets used daily and I’ve tried to keep it cleaned but recently it stopped grinding coffee beans. It does a little but most of what it seems to pull out of the hopper seems to get stuck.

I’ve taken it apart and cleaned it thoroughly with brushes and when the problem persisted I got something similar to Grindz cleaner to run through it. The cleaner is shaped kind of like coffee beans but made of a food safe proxy of some sort that is supposed to soak up residual oils and clean the grinder more thoroughly. This went through without any problems at all. I thought it had fixed the problem but when I tried running actual coffee beans through it again I got the same — odd noise, almost nothing coming out of it, and it seeming like bean parts are getting stuck below the hopper in the grinder and just bouncing around.

I don’t know if there’s something I’m missing in how to clean this grinder properly, if the burrs can and do need to be replaced, or if it’s time to replace my grinder with something newer. Your suggestions and advice are appreciated!"

I purchased a burr grinder as my parents Christmas gift last december. First they made a mistake and shipped a kettle instead. I had to open something like 4 or 5 tickets on their website for them to finally acknowledge me and ship the correct item, sometime in late january (so, to late to give as a Christmas gift).

Now, said grinder has began malfunctioning and making a very loud noise when grinding, constantly. From searching around the web, it may be the torque limiter constantly slipping. There's nothing stuck in the burrs though, it spins freely when beans are removed.

I have now attempted to reach out to them 5 times for troubleshooting and warranty service, starting back in august when the issue began. Complete radio silence from Bodum.

So I for one will not be purchasing anything from Bodum in the future, and would not recommend them to anyone either. Searching this sub reveals many other people who had the same experience as I have.

Edit: In full fairness, I wanted to mention that Bodum from finally replied to my support tickets and I was issued a refund on September 30th, over a month after I opened the first ticket. I still will not be purchasing any Bodum product again and would recommend anyone to avoid them as well. Besides the doubtful quality of the product, ghosting customers for over a month  when they try to contact service is just not acceptable to me."

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1njgl1d/why_is_this_specialty_coffee_more_dense_than_my,Why is this specialty coffee more dense than my,"Long-time browser, first-time poster. I've been brewing using Chemex pour-over for almost a year now, and in that time have dialed in a pretty good and consistent grind size, bean:water ratio, and brew time.
Grinder: Fellow Opus
Grind size:7
Ratio: 1:18 (30g beans, 550g water)
Brew time: 5-6 minutes

About 4 months ago, I tried a subscription to Trade to get some new specialty beans, just to try it and see if l'd enjoy. What I found is that all 4 beans so far (first picture) have been far denser than my go-to San Francisco Bay beans (second picture).

The brewing of the specialty coffees behaves very differently. The bloom takes longer for the water to soak through, and throughout the rest of the pour, the flow of water through the filter is significantly slower. It gets to the point that even at the largest grind-size my grinder allows (11), the brew stalls and only drips. If I were to let it continue without intervention, it would take well over 10 minutes. I constantly need to pick up the filter and hold it, which think brings more pressure focused to the bottom of the filter? (Dunno).

Anyone know why they're so much denser?"

Hey everyone, I’m a coffee lover and recently decided to try growing a coffee plant at home. With the help of AI (Google Gemini) and some online guides, I came up with two germination methods for the seeds:

1. Soaking the seeds fully in water for 5 days;
2. Placing the seeds in a damp paper towel inside a sealed bag to keep the moisture. Both methods are kept in a dark environment

I started the germination on September 14. On the next day, I noticed that the seeds in the paper towel turned green, while the ones soaking in water didn’t change. Today, I checked again and the two sets of seeds now look completely different. Some posts online say the green color might be from chlorogenic acid, but others suggest it could actually be mold.

Has anyone tried germinating coffee seeds and seen something similar? Any tips or thoughts would be really appreciated"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1nhdm8m/cafe_owners_what_kind_of_conversations_do_you,Cafe owners what kind of conversations do you,"So I recently had an interesting (and slightly awkward) encounter with a coffee shop owner.

I didn’t even realize he was the owner at first, because he was just chilling at one of the customer seats. When I walked in he casually asked me what I wanted to order. I asked for a V60 pourover, and he recommended a certain bean.

The conversation after the brew started a bit rough. After he served me the cup, he asked “How’s the coffee?” and I replied that it was a bit too acidic and sour for my taste. He immediately offered to make another one to prove a concept, and the second cup turned out great.

Fast forward, I tried to chat with him about his 11+ years of experience, but honestly I felt like he wasn’t that interested. Maybe my questions were too generic, or maybe I just didn’t know what to say other than asking about his journey in coffee. Lmao I even commented about his cat (which was IMO comment-worthy fat and chunky - it's his ""*cafe cat*"" btw) since I had nothing left to ask.

So I’m curious to ask other **cafe owners** here:

* What kind of conversations spark your interest?
* Do you enjoy being asked about your background and coffee journey, or do you get that question so often it gets boring?
* From a customer who’s “just a homebrewer” (I’ve been making V60s for years, but I don’t have refined taste buds... I just know if I like it or maybe not for me), what would be a better way to step up my coffee conversations?

**TLDR:** I met a cafe owner, convo was awkward, and I’d like tips on how to have better coffee conversations as a casual homebrewer. What topics do you enjoy discussing with customers?"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1nfuie5/has_coffee_pricing_changed_how_you_buy_beans,Has coffee pricing changed how you buy beans,"An email from one of the companies I buy from landed this morning, advising impending price rises. With wholesale costs up around 160% over the last two years, I’ve already changed how I buy whole beans. Go far enough back and 250g bags were the standard size, and my practice was to explore variety and buy maybe three or four bags a month. Shrinkflation started to kick in and 220g bags are now the norm. Increasingly though, suppliers I bought from introduced the 1kg option.  I switched to that purchase weight a few months ago. As the email I received points out, buying at that weight typically saves up to 20% per 100g compared to the smaller bag size. I’m casting wider in my search for suppliers, where I used to buy from just one or two.  I don’t feel I’ve lost out in any real sense, just that I’m spending more time with one or two different brews instead of three or four."

It often tastes great and far better than i can achieve at home.

I have no doubt that there are lots of techniques and things i am not doing right to get the most from my beans. Given that coffee is mostly made of water, i was wondering if anyone could give me tips on how to test the water and alternative things i should be looking out for. I travel around a lot. Is there a good bottled water to use, or do i have to amend my technique to a given water type?

I’ve lived in the Middle East for most of my life and moved to Canada recently. I’ve been trying to figure out my general coffee preferences here, because I find most coffees I’ve tried here have a sort of acidic taste I don’t particularly enjoy. It’s not a roast issue I think, because I enjoy Saudi and Turkey coffee which are light roasts, and when I got coffee for pour overs back home I’d get medium roast coffee and not darker than that. When I’ve tried to purchase from local coffee roasters here, I’ve found they’re quite acidic ? and have a taste I don’t really love. I found I don’t mind Lavazza coffee from a local cafe, and I honestly don’t mind Folgers medium roast. I really dislike Bridgehead coffee, at all roast levels.

I’ve ran three cycles through the machine of water after the descaler, and I’ll probably run a few more after, have I cooked his machine? It seems to be functioning fine and since afaik it’s a pressure driven water system as opposed to a pump it should be ok just running water through, but I wanted to check if I needed to do anything else or if I should just start ordering replacement parts and apology cards and another machine for my brother to use while I fix his.

I just started my first barista job at a boulangerie, and I could really use some advice. I’m comfortable with basics like americanos and iced lattes, but I’m really struggling with steaming milk. My front-of-house manager expects me to know it already, but I was never properly trained, I mostly just shadowed them a few times.

I’ve watched YouTube tutorials, and I get the theory, but I know this is something you only really get good at through practice. The problem is, I don’t want to waste too much milk, and I feel like practicing with soap and water in the pitcher only helps to a point. When it gets busy, I also don’t have much room to experiment.

For those of you who’ve been here before, do you have any tips for improving milk steaming quickly? Or practice methods that actually helped you feel more confident without wasting tons of milk? Any encouragement would mean a lot. I want to do well, but right now it feels overwhelming.

Thanks in advance!"
https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1n9m8ny/what_is_turkish_coffee_supposed_to_taste_like,What is turkish coffee supposed to taste like,"I’ve had three different kinds of Turkish / Greek (which I believe is supposed to taste similar) recently and they all seemed so different.

The Greek coffee was served in an espresso cup. It had sediment in the bottom, foam on top, and had some sort of caramel sweet flavor to it. It was very smooth and delicious.

I had Turkish coffee at two different places. The first place was a baked potato shop owned by (Turkish?) immigrants. It was served in a to-go small coffee cup. It seemed like 4 - 6oz of coffee. It was strong and smooth, had sediment at the bottom, had a slightly sweet flavor but no other notable flavors besides a dark coffee taste. It took the owner quite a while to make and was hot as hell for like 20 minutes after it was served.

The second place was a Turkish cafe. It did not take them long to make it, maybe 5 minutes at most. It tasted like someone had mixed cigarette ashes with espresso, put a teaspoon of sugar in it, and then served it in these tiny 2oz or so, beautiful espresso cups. It was gross, and neither of us that ordered it finished it. And it was hot, but cooled down quickly (assuming because it was only 2oz).

So what are the flavors of this supposed to be? And the presentation? I feel like every time I order this from a new place I just hold my breath and hope it enjoy it."

I am awaiting my delivery of a Seimans EQ300.

Seimans say that you must use their own brand cleaning and descaling tablets and not to use citric acid or vinegar. Obviously this will just become pricey over time. Seimans also say to replace the water filter every TWO MONTHS!! This seems like overkill and will surely rack up the costs and is also rather inconvenient.

In other people's experience, is all this really necessary. My cynical mind says that it is just a money grab. They say that vinegar and citric acid can wear down seals and components. Surely if you dilute with correct ratios this shouldn't be a problem.

I understand the importance of maintaining but at the same time are Seimans trying to money grab where they can?

I'd much rather be able to just pick up some citric acid and white vinegar in my local store when needed rather than having to order expensive products online.

Just wondering if anyone has any experience with this? How do you clean your machines?

I was dreading the moment the coffee poops and anxiety kicked in but they never did. I continued to have coffee each day and it felt like a miracle that I never got any of the bad side effects I normally do when I get coffee in the states.

Is there an explanation for this? I assumed that the beans were just of better quality, but we import most of our beans in the US so that wouldn’t make a ton of sense.

It pushed me toward switching to moka pots. I bought a stainless steel one. I drink in the same cup i used to make my Nespresso double shot in (set at 100ml). But the moka pot coffee, is way much stronger. Some days it's smooth and very delicious, some days it's bitter af. I do everything the same, I control the heat, it never spits and sputters. Same amount of coffee. I've watched couple of videos, but they're way over complicated and are targeted toward professional coffee makers.

I know the ultimate answer to grinder selection and grind size is taste. Until I perfect my pallet, I look to recipes as my crutches. The jist of calibration according to Kuve is to aim to have the weight of boulders equal the weight of fines. This presumes that the taste detriment of each is equal by weight.

Alternatively, perhaps it’s just an aide to  grinder selection."

I’m your regular coffee nerd who’s doing a lot of ‘spro and pours, but also has a habit of picking up espresso machines on the cheap to repair. I’d like to share two stories.

I bought a Gaggia Baby that was sold cheap because flow was low. Checking it out, flow was low but decent so I decided to descale. After the machine remained idle with some descaler in the boiler, the flow was reduced to one drop every second. Source in pictures 1 and 2: the scale was mobilized and fully occluded the tubes. I had to open it up all the way in order to clean everything out. This can be prevented by regular descaling.

Then I received a Demoka M-363 free that ‘suddenly stopped working’. Picture 3 shows the issue, encountered by only unscrewing the dispersion screen (one screw!). After a bath in Cafiza it was ready for further maintenance and making me a nice little profit.

For those who are not quite familiar with their machines: first watch James Hoffmann’s video on YT on cleaning and maintenance, then take a screwdriver and get busy: you’ll find your espresso machine is really easy to open and tinker with (this includes all semi-automatic Delonghi, Gaggia, Smeg, Casabrew, HiBrew and more fancy machines).

Cheers and have a well extracted day!"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1mzs5nr/started_playing_with_high_concentration_brews_why,Started playing with high concentration brews why,"It all started with me trying to dial in decaf. It was hard to reach a consistent non-burnt taste. Ended up doing finer (not much) grind sizes, and using just 2/3 of water and the other 1/3 just topping up the final brew. (Filter and aeropress, whichever is not on the dishwasher at the time)

This to me yield a more consistent, sweet forward brew, without the harshness you can get on decafs (might be skill issue, but hey, anything that makes it easier counts!)

So, now I started playing with the idea on my normal brews. Went a couple of notches finer on a natural process, and proceeded with same technique.

To my surprise, I found that I could feel much more of the complexity of the coffee, but avoided most of the “too fine” issues I’d have if I tried to just “reduce agitation” and so on.

My theory is that with more water passing through the beans, you might extract more but you also can take more of the bitter “powdery” compounds. Having it finer but less water going through counter balances it. But that’s a uneducated guess

Does anybody have tried this?"

I know robusta beans tend to be bitter and darker compared to arabica, but I really want to try to get the best out of robusta beans with my aeropress setup. I've been using james hoffman's aeropress recipe, and adjusted it a little bit to account for the darker roast.

Here's my recipe:

* 11g of coffee to 200ml of water at 85-90 degrees
* 14 clicks on the Timemore C3
* 2 minutes of brewing, then a gentle swirl and another extra 30 seconds of wait

Also, some coffee sellers I inquired told me that robusta isn’t as flavorful and has more caffeine.  My own taste tells me that mixing robusta with arabica at 50/50 ratio gives a great espresso.

The topic of steaming milk came up, and she’s insisting there’s nothing called “foam” when it comes to coffee, and that all milk is supposed to be the same consistency. Whereas i was taught that a cappuccino for instance is supposed to have a defined layer of foam on top compared to let’s say a latte. She also said there’s no such thing as a double cappuccino, and that that would be a flat white?

We are from two different countries, so i suppose it could be a regional thing, but i wanted to know what the consensus is in general? Is there supposed to be a difference in the consistency of the milk in a latte, a cappuccino and a flat white?"

some logistics: i already have a full time job that i'm at three days a week, so this would just be a side gig for the other 3 days. ideally, i would only want to open this for the morning rush so 6am to around 11am from thursdays-saturdays. i was thinking of starting at my own apartment building and asking the building managers if i could operate from the lobby for tenants and then also ideally operate at a nearby hospital since it's very busy all the time.

the vision i have is really to just keep it simple: an espresso machine with a small refrigerator to store dairy products, limited flavors, and really sell my own unique flavors (i have had a home espresso machine for years so i've experimented a LOT).

i honestly don't even care to make a huge profit, the thought was to sell maybe 100-150 cups a day for those three days and just have a small side income, but really i just have been thinking of going into the coffee business for a long time now and am very passionate about it, so this seemed the best way to step foot into it since if all hell breaks loose, i'm not tied down to it and can just stop and have my full time job still.

I usually grind for V60 or my Oxo 8 cup maker and haven't had too much trouble turning the knob.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1mt4add/is_a_french_press_necessary,Is a french press necessary,"I'm relatively new to making coffee for myself. I've been exposed to lots of good coffee (and bad coffee) and have a decent idea of what to be looking for in brews.

I've invested in a v60, a switch, a moka pot, and a French press. I've mostly been brewing Dak coffee (Milky Cake, Strawberry Jelly, Berry Blues, Peachy Daze), for better or worse, lol.

I've been exploring different brewing methods and recipes, often back to back so I can a/b stuff. As I started to experiment with the French Press (using Hoffman's method), it occurred to me that the filter part of that process is really not doing much work at all, especially if you have a nice grinder and decant gently/carefully at the end of the brewing process. Today, as an experiment, I made an immersion brew in a preheated 300 ml double walked carafe, following Hoffman's method. At the end, I simply decanted the coffee very carefully and, to my palate, ended up with a very nice immersion brew. Lovely all around really. I sacrifice a few ml of coffee at the very bottom so as to not stir up the grounds, but that's really not an issue for me.

My question is... am I missing something? This seems so easy. I can use a lovely double walled carafe. Temperatures remain high throughout extraction. I don't have to fiddle with a press element. It really just seems so perfectly simple.

Am I missing something?"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1mql86u/large_batch_espresso_question,Large batch espresso question,"Hey everyone, I’m new to this subreddit (mostly been a lurker/commenter until now) and I want to tap into your expertise.

Hypothetically, you're running a batch coffee operation in Indonesia, currently making about 1,000 cups/day. Right now, the modus operandi is using a single-group espresso machine, which requires a very consistent barista hand to operate all day. It works for now, but in the long run, I personally think it’s not the most efficient setup (CMIIW). The plan is to double output by the end of the year.

I have a couple of questions for anyone who’s worked with large-scale espresso production:

1. Is it realistically possible to make **a large amount of espresso using only one piece of equipment**, while still keeping the water-to-coffee ratio consistent?
2. If yes, do you have any equipment recommendations (brands/models) I could check out for reference?

Disclaimer: I’m honestly just curious and want to understand what kind of scaling is possible for espresso production. Who knows, this knowledge might come in handy for future coffee adventures.

Thanks for your insights!"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1mpkezr/undercounter_dishwasher_in_service_area_good_idea,Undercounter dishwasher in service area good idea,"I posted previously about our design for a new cafe and got some good feedback. One of the suggestions people had was to hire a consultant, which I had already suggested to the cafe owners many, many times as we've been designing over the last four weeks. They said, it's not happening - very confident never worked as baristas before.

The owners (husband and wife) were talking with an owner of another cafe this week who urgently recommended they meet with a local coffee shop consultant they know. The owners have now met with her, and she had so many good suggestions on every aspect of the cafe. They are going to retain her through opening for inventory setup and training - Yay!

This will be a combination coffee-donut shop and is going into a trendy and growing part of the city. The owners do have lots of restaurant and bakery experience, but as workers not owners.

https://preview.redd.it/licvtfq56vif1.jpg?width=1886&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b65d61cc394d45ebc501fb289e876819c5d69c72

Three of the consultant’s layout recommendations surprised me - both me and the owners have talked with many local baristas and cafe owners to get to the current plan. I'd love to hear about others' experiences to help us evaluate her recommendations.

**Where to put an undercounter dishwasher?**

One of coffee shops I've been to had a residential dishwasher in the front counter service area. Two had  undercounter commercial units. Two others had commercial dishwashers in a back food prep or bakery area. Several had none - small coffee shops, so washed dishes by hand (health department rules?). We were having a hard time deciding on the optimal spot for the dishwasher in our design, so I asked at every place I visited for opinions on the matter.

The universal opinion was out front with basin sink adjacent (several dishwashers were stuck in an odd location or away from sinks). And get a commercial undercounter unit with two stacked baskets.

I never thought to ask if there are negatives with noise, both from the dishwasher and clanging dishes when loading and unloading, and no one ever mentioned such issues. Several people did mention the convenience of dishwashing at slow times without having to leave the store front when working alone.

The Consultant said a dishwasher should *never* be out front - it's too messy and you'll have steam and water dripping everywhere. During busy times, loading and unloading will take up valuable space and inconvenience others. It's also very loud when running.

I'm a regular cafe/coffee shop goer, and at my favorite local shop, I have never noticed their (commercial) dishwasher running, and I have spent hundreds of hours lingering there. I have seen the owner or employees loading and unloading it during business hours, but its noise is just part of the background noise you expect at a cafe.

**Where to locate an ice maker?**

Another decision we went round and round on. We finally decided that the best quality models were too tall to go under standard counter heights (and have Health Dept. length legs) and needed extra depth, so it should go at the last place in the workflow. In our case, that would be below the pickup station.

The Consultant says it should be nearer to the point of sale (we are stuck with this L-shaped layout, so that's not changing at this point), and opposite the coffee station, so that when there's a customer crush, a second person can quickly step in with iced drinks and still be near the register (and donut displays).

**Undercounter open shelves or doors and drawers?**

The owners set a goal of having a very neat and well-ordered place - no cheap convenience store look with dirt and cobwebs in every open nook and cranny. The place should feel clean. The counters will have most everything needed out for easy access but otherwise uncluttered.

I always recommend full-extension drawers under counters when you know what kind of inventory you'll have. If everything is in large boxes and stays in large boxes until pulled for individual use, then shelves can make sense, but then you can always have larger drawers and pull the tops off of boxes for easy access. I have clients ask for drawers in standard base cabinets before I even make recommendations, with them believing drawers beat shelving hands down in most circumstances. Things get lost in deep shelves and it's just plain harder to see things when you have to bend down low and sort through layers.

We also have a fair amount of open shelving space in the back of the store - it seems you can never have enough storage space.

The Consultant says *no* drawers or doors and *shelves only* \- at peak times when everyone is rushing about, opening drawers (20"" extension into a 42"" aisle) and cabinet doors get in the way of other workers. No doors allow one to just reach down and grab. No fuss, no muss - I guess.

We were planning on very large drawers in about 2/3rds of the cabinets (we have a lot of cabinets -[ link to elevations if you are interested](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nEjWv4gNZqdiznxWUuF7j2hQl5B05hON?usp=sharing)), and several base units with doors with moveable shelves mostly for the donut boxes and the thinking is they'd stack the unfolded boxes on the counter above for quick grab for to go and large orders.

The other option is to have roll out shelves, but are those really better than drawers - guess it depends on whether you have doors in front?

The biggest problem in knowing what's best is that we cannot predict how long rush times will last. Should everything be designed for that peak time and an occasional need to get in a drawer?

One thing the majority of the baristas (not owners) I talked with said is that you just adjust to the workplace circumstances you are given. People expect to sometimes have to wait at rush times, and saving a couple of seconds here and there at those times is not their highest priority. That attitude would be blasphemy to [Frederick Winslow Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Winslow_Taylor)."

I’m new to the world of espresso and just got an entry-level espresso machine (Daewoo CM1000). I’ve been reading that espresso, lungo, and americano are often made with the **same amount of ground coffee**, and the difference is only in how much water you use (either during extraction or by adding hot water afterwards).

One of my goals is to get a lungo with a flavor **similar to what I get from my moka pot**. I know the brewing method is different, but what I don’t want is a thin, watery coffee that tastes diluted.

I’d love to get your opinions on this:

* Do you use the same coffee dose for all three drinks?
* How much water do you typically run through for each?
* For a lungo, is it better to extend the shot or to pull a normal espresso and add water?
* Any tips for getting the best flavor out of an entry-level machine?

So to all those French press users I was wanting to hear what works for you, how you froth milk and general press tips in general.
- do you create a stronger brew (ratio of 1:13 instead of a 1:17) when you are adding milk?
- would you ever consider adding the frothed milk before adding coffee or stirring the milk?
- try something other than whole milk (half and half, oat milk, almond, etc)

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1miy4sg/a_rather_cheap_setup_for_decent_coffee,A rather cheap setup for decent coffee,"It might not be news to you guys, but i am really surprised by how great coffee from a 12 euro french press turns out to be. I used a decent darker roast from a local coffee shop, a 1zpresso handgrinder and followed James Hoffmann's recipe. Voilà ... very drinkable coffee without spending a fortune. I'd argue that you don't even need the 1zpresso hand grinder since the french press does well with coarser grinds.

I think the beans do most of the work, but i am really surprised how this has turned out.
Do you actually need expensive coffee gear if you are just having coffee? Feels like it only starts to get expensive when you get into espresso."

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1mja1k4/coffee_business_from_my_dorm,Coffee business from my dorm,"Hi! So basically in a few weeks, I’m heading off to college and rooming with my cousin! We were coming up with ideas to start businesses (I know it’s ambitious lol). With us both liking coffee, we came up with the idea of selling espresso since I recently got a cheap espresso machine. We had no idea how much we’d sell them for.

However recently, I’ve found that cold brew might be a much better idea instead. It’s cheaper to make, stays fresh longer, and easier to make from a dorm. I did the math and found that to make one cup of coffee it would cost around 60 cents USD. The coffee shops around campus are on the pricier side, so I think even selling it for cheap would be a good idea (just to sort of get our presence known first).

Eventually we could add other stuff like protein or cold foam or espresso shots too, but idk that’s still far away lol. My school is one that is very supportive of the “entrepreneurial spirit”, so I don’t imagine they’d be super opposed to what we’re doing. But I haven’t checked so I don’t know. A lot of this is just speculation and wishful thinking lol

Anyway what do you think? Does it seem profitable, easily maintainable, and wanted in the market? I think providing cheap, good tasting coffee to exhausted college students would be a good thing to do. Let me know!"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1mfwl5s/how_do_i_learn_to_enjoy_properly_brewed_coffee,How do i learn to enjoy properly brewed coffee,"Hello, r/coffee! First post here.

I’ve been drinking Nespresso pods at home for ~3 years. I always knew it was subpar coffee, but it got the job done. And I don’t even make them right: I buy whatever capsule pack is cheaper and I just lungo everything. Even ristretto. I noticed pretty quickly that capsules taste pretty much all the same to me, except that some are more or less bitter than others.

As I said, I always knew Nespresso pods were bad coffee. At some point, it also started becoming expensive coffee. I did the math of cost per cup, and I concluded I would actually spend less on average per day if I made a small investment in equipment to brew at home.

I got excited.

I was going to drink better coffee, and save money? Hell yeah!

I did some research on the best brewing method for my conditions and preferences, and pretty quickly landed on the Clever Dripper. So I bought everything I needed to get started.

Not only I live in Brazil, but I live very close to where a lot of our specialty coffee is cultivated. I bought a pack of verifiably high quality coffee beans. I don’t have a grinder at home (yet?), so I asked a guy at my favorite coffee place to ground for Clever for me, which I very much trust was done right.

I’m using 20g of coffee for 300ml of water. I’m preparing it per James Hoffman instructions I saw on YouTube.

**And… I don’t really love it.** I don’t even like at much as my espresso pods.

What’s wrong with me? My brain knows this coffee is much “better”, but I genuinely like the shitty espresso significantly more. It has more bite. It comes out hotter. I love the stupid crema.

And this is not a knee-jerk reaction. I’ve been insisting on the Clever brew for a couple of months already. I’m on my third pack of beans. I drink it most days, because I want to “get used” to it, but I still want to reach for the Nespresso pretty much every time — and sometimes I do.

Again: what’s wrong with me? Why do I like the worst coffee more? I know it’s weird to ask for advice on this, but… do you have any?

Thanks."

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1mduks3/dosage_vs_grind_size,Dosage vs grind size,"I’ve been having difficulty dialing in with this coffee I recently got.

I’ve had the espresso bar since 5 years now; and I usually can dial in new beans in a couple of trial shots.

I have the GCP with PID, 9-bar pressure mod and use a non-pressurised basket. With a Mignon Specialita grinder.

Typically I stick to an 18g dose; and work with my grind size, temperature and shot-time to get what I find optimal.

These new beans are super tricky — I almost had to dial in daily…and the slightest difference in grind size led to a bit difference in shot-time. Sometimes there’s sputtering even after very careful puck-prep (WDT + pressurised tamper)

Today when I’m almost done with the coffee, I tried a larger dose for the heck of it (yesterday again the shot was too quick; even though I use the coffee daily).

So in went about 18.5g, and the overall shot flow was so much smoother. It was still quick, but it was as expected. I think I have some more coffee and should be able to try one more 19g shot.

My brain is telling me that there’s some fluid mechanics thing that’s working better with the extra height that’s achieved with a larger dose? Tell me I’m overthinking this; or if you’ve experienced something similar. Maybe I need to learn something about doses — point me in the right direction.

First of all, I understand that any true coffee enthusiast will take it upon themselves to invest in a decent homebrew set up, so don't chastize me. however, periodically, people find themselves in a scenario where they need to use a drip coffee maker. why does the hot plate at the bottom get so hot???? like wtf. it literally evaporates the coffee out of the pot, and after an hour and a half or so if you don't drink all the liquid, you will be left with a toxic sludge. This level of heat degrades the compounds inside your brew, so even after ten minutes or so, there will be a burnt/carbon/caramelized taste in your cup that shouldn't be there. is it simply assumed that the average consumer has no taste buds and prioritizes temperature over quality?"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1m88lwj/help_me_understand_a_trend_of_tasteless_espresso,Help me understand a trend of tasteless espresso,"Hi coffee people, I’m hoping you can help me understand something.  I enjoy coffee, especially a good cappuccino. I haven’t gone full coffee enthusiast at home, mostly because my other pursuits take up my time, but I seek out great coffee shops whenever I can. I’m in the San Francisco Bay Area, so I’m lucky to have a lot of good options to choose from.

Over the past year however, I’ve noticed a strange trend: tasteless coffee.  I’ve been to 4 or 5 places now that appear to be serious about their coffee, but their cappuccinos taste like nothing but milk.  The first time this happened, I actually got a spoon and looked under the foam to be sure there was coffee in my drink.  It’s not even that they’re bad cappuccinos, just that they don’t taste like coffee at all.

I’m wondering, is this the result of some high-end trend in roasting beans or pulling shots?  Are coffee shops choosing to do this to make it easier to make fancy coffee drinks - the orange tonics or lavender-salt lattes etc that are so prevalent now?  Or are these shops just not good at making espresso, but in such a way that the coffee isn’t bad, just bland?

TLDR: confused and under-caffeinated cappuccino drinker wonders why high-end coffee shops are making tasteless coffee."

It's considered an internship because it's short-term. I want to pitch this nationally, but my editor is asking some questions... she wants to know if the coffee industry is hard to get into. If having a career in coffee that goes beyond a corporate barista job is hard but worth it, and if this internship would help them get their foot in the door. What do y'all think?

The thing is, this is a light honey (white honey style) from Colombia. After depulping, we rinse off part of the mucilage — about 80% — but intentionally leave around 20% to dry on the parchment. There’s no fermentation in water, and no full washing like a traditional washed process. The drying is done on raised beds, and the final profile is noticeably different from the fully washed lot we’ve also sold from the same origin.

He argued that any use of water to remove mucilage = washed. I disagree. I understand honey is a spectrum, and I’ve seen white honey processes that use light rinsing to control fermentation without fully removing mucilage.

Also — he claimed you can tell the process just by looking at the green coffee. I’m skeptical. I’ve seen washed and honey coffees that look almost identical depending on drying and storage.

Still, he says although we leave some mucilage, the beans still look light and fully washed.

Curious to hear your thoughts. I’m don’t have much experience buying green coffee but have read a lot about it."

Utter failure every time. Tried widely varied grind settings on a DF64 with SSP multipurpose burrs. Calibrated.

Then I ran out of my magnesium/potassium/sodium/calcium brew water and said, ""F it. I'll try a different water recipe."" Changed it up to purely calcium/potassium. Then I accidentally brewed 1:18 instead of the usual 1:17.

I brewed the sweetest cup of my life. I am still not convinced that my wife had accidentally left some residual sugar in that mug somehow. It was so brown sugary sweet and delicious.

My little victory for the day. The water change and the increased ratio were the only changed variables."

I will be a new/first time parent come October! I love my daily cup of coffee. I'm pickier with my coffee than your average coffee drinker — most of my friends consider me a coffee enthusiast — but to your coffee + brewing experts I would be considered a beginner.

Anyways — I'm looking for opinions on what my best brewing option will be for getting through the newborn phase/life as a new parent. Some details:

* I currently either make pour over or french press depending on the day. I occasionally use my moka pot, and do cold brew in the summer. I have a feeling that with busy newborn baby life, I am going to be about 100x more likely to walk away from/get distracted while making any of these coffee options thus resulting in no coffee/cold coffee/messy stove situations (and my baby will be born in the fall when I prefer a hot cup of coffee).
* My husband does not drink coffee, so I am usually looking for around 12-16 oz. of coffee for myself, to make myself. I drink 1 cup a day in the AM, but may be more likely to add in a midday coffee once baby is here.
* Keurig is a hard no (assuming that doesn't need to be said on this sub)
* My grinder recently broke so I'm also in need of a new grinder — potentially open to combo grinder/coffee maker set ups if there is one that works well for smaller quantity brews.
* I'm already considering an aeropress, but open to more automatic options if they can do a decent 1-2 cup brew"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1lrmqi4/caffeine_content_comparison,Caffeine content comparison,"Just got back from a trip to Milan with my girlfriend, and one thing we both noticed: we were drinking espresso constantly- like, multiple times a day, even in the evening- and neither of us had any issues sleeping. No jitters, no racing heart, no staring at the ceiling at 2am.

At home (UK), I have to stop at one or two coffees max and nothing past say 2pm or I’m wired for hours. So now I’m wondering: is there an actual difference in caffeine content between Italian coffee and what we get in the UK?

Is it the roast level (since Italian espresso is usually quite dark)? The serving size? The extraction method? Maybe the kind of beans they use? Or is it just the fact we were on holiday in 35°C heat surrounded by carbs and doing 20k steps a day?

Would love to hear from anyone who actually knows the science (or has had a similar experience)."

I have a La Marzocco Linea PB 2AV espresso machine wired for 380V 3-phase power. My electrical supply is 40A single-phase (230V) (it’s clearly marked ""40 AMP 1-Φ"" on my panel).

I’ve read that some people successfully convert these machines by bridging L1, L2, and L3 at the terminal block inside the machine and connecting that to their single-phase live wire.

Here are the details:

Machine: La Marzocco Linea PB 2AV Total power: about 4400W Power supply: 230V single-phase, 40A available Machine wiring colors: Brown, Black, Grey (phases), Blue (neutral), Green/Yellow (earth)

Questions:

Can I safely bridge L1, L2, and L3 inside the machine and connect them to my single-phase live wire?

Has anyone done this specific conversion on the Linea PB? Any wiring diagrams, photos, or tips would be really appreciated."
https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1lrpcln/home_made_melodrip_switch_recipe,Home made melodrip switch recipe,"Hi everyone! I recently picked up a Hario switch and began experimenting. After watching Lance's video about fine migration, I decided to mill my own melodrip and get to work trying to make the sweetest, smoothest cup I could. I made my own pseudo-melodrip by milling a much of 2mm holes into a 1/3 cup stainless measuring cup i had lying around.

Here's the result:
1. Add 90 grams of 75°C water to a preheated, rinsed switch.
2. Add 30 grams of coffee coarsely ground
3. Lightly mix together so the grounds are saturated. The slower the better, to reduce fine migration.
4. Let bloom for at least 1 minute. Heat kettle to 94°C (or whatever you prefer) during this time.
5. Add 360 grams of water to the switch, pouring lightly through a melodrip (or through a cheese grater, or homemade melodrip, or anything like that. Basically eliminate all agitation).
6. Lightly mix together to ensure grounds are evenly saturated once again
7. Wait 4-5 minutes
8. Flip switch. If all was done correctly, it will drain in 45 seconds or less, due to the lack of fine migration
9. Enjoy :)

Following this recipe, I've created the least bitter, most flavorful cups I have ever tasted (mostly home made so that may not mean anything). The first time I did this, I used a cheese grater to break up the flow. The second time, I used my homemade melodrip. They were both equally tasty."

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1lrngez/golden_ratio_do_you_use_it,Golden ratio do you use it,"I have been somewhat of a coffee hobbyist for a number of years now, meaning I started grinding beans, using various brewing methods (75% Aeropress, plus Moka pot and pour over), and making different recipes hot and cold.  However I never bothered with a scale, I knew my Aeropress scoop was about 15 grams of coffee.  I recently bought a scale and decided to follow some recipes. I do not use my pour over dripper much because it never produced a really satisfying cup, but I figure it was in the technique. So I followed a recipe using the ""golden"" 15:1 ratio, using 15 grams of coffee to 225 grams water. Wow that seemed like a lot of water and the coffee was really weak, in my opinion. I started experimenting with pour over and my go to Aeropress and I realized that what I usually drink for a normal cup, is about 10:1 sometimes even less. During this process I did drink a number of cups at around 12 or 13:1, and I could taste a nice balance, nuances that may be lost in a stronger cup, but overall it still seems weak to me, with little body.

So this has me wondering about this golden ratio, like where it came from. Maybe the US because Americans typically drink weaker coffee than many other parts of the world? The obvious take is that I am simply used to, and enjoy a stronger cup. I am curious how many coffee enthusiasts, when brewing a cup, enjoy the ""golden ratio"" or enjoy stronger or weaker?"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1lpekqw/flash_brew_iced_coffee_hario_switch_recipe,Flash brew iced coffee hario switch recipe,"For anyone who might be interested, here's an approach I've been enjoying (inspired by Tetsu Kasuya's hybrid and no bloom techniques). This is all I've been drinking for the last couple of years.

**Ratio:** 1:10 (50g coffee, 350g water, 150g ice)
**Coffee:** Light to Medium roast (I usually drink Ethiopians)
**Grind:** Medium Fine (I use 4 on the Fellow Ode 2)
**1st Pour (Switch Down):** 175g boiling water, no bloom, fast pour
**2nd Pour (Switch Up):** 175g cooler water (\~85C), immersion for five minutes
**Ice:** 75g added to my tumbler before each pour, then more added later

The logic of no bloom with boiling water is to maximize the aromatic, fruitier flavors of the roast. There's admittedly some room to doubt the logic here as I buy 5lb bags of coffee once ever 1.5 months, so the beans end up being a bit older and more degassed than what would be typical if you're drinking freshly roasted coffee. But in my experience, the subsequent immersion phase compensates for whatever the first one lacks, and vice versa.

Sharing for anyone who's interested in hybrid techniques like this, but open to any suggested tweaks."

Are there really this many people doing it illegally or am I getting the wrong information. I'm doing my research to make sure I do this right but it's not making any sense. I live in Phoenix and here I am not allowed to sell espresso based drinks under the food cottage program, so I would have to build a coffee cart. But with the amount of regulations on equipment and permits I would need to get, my total cost would be 8000 to 15000. Luckily I already have my espresso machine and everything else that I need to MAKE the drinks. Now I would need the stuff for the cart. Do people really have this kind of money to do this? Is it just patience while slowly building it, or is there something else I'm missing? I find it hard to believe that there are so many people who would actually spend the money to do this as a side gig.

 1) What's it like as a spectator? Is it a “good show” or more like an “insiders event”? What can you see? Is it viable gift idea at all?
 2) How much time should we realistically allocate to the WBC within HostMilano? Is one full day enough to get a good feel, or should we plan for more?
 3) Beyond the main competition, are there other interesting events/activities  for an amateur coffee lover at HostMilano? Are there specific halls or areas not to miss for specialty coffee, equipment, or other smaller competitions?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1lipksx/hario_switch_match_confusion_do_the_cones,Hario switch match confusion do the cones,"I understand the concept of 'Switch and Match,' but I feel like I’m being really stupid here…

What exactly is the leaf-shaped base of the cone for? Does the cone detach from this base and then fit into the Switch? Or do I put it in the Switch as-is?

I want to get the 02-sized Switch & Match Ceramic Dripper along with a Dripper Switch, then hopefully add an 03 cone later that will also fit the same Immersion Switch I already have.

Is anyone able to confirm that the cones are interchangeable with the same Switch base? Or explain if these work any differently compared to the standard Hario Switch V60 Ceramic Immersion Dripper you can get outside of the 'Switch and Match? Thanks!

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1lh22hx/is_espresso_still_a_ritual_or_just_a_tuning_game,Is espresso still a ritual or just a tuning game,"I got into espresso at home thinking it would feel like an extension of the café experience.

Pulling a shot, steaming milk, maybe making a cappuccino on a quiet morning, it all sounded like a kind of ritual, not just a recipe.

But as I went deeper, I found myself chasing numbers more than moments. Suddenly I was timing shots to the second, adjusting grind size by fractions, watching temp shifts, worrying about pressure curves, and wondering if I needed better puck prep tools.

The coffee was fine, but the fun was… fading. It felt like I had turned something calming into something clinical.

So I stepped back. It felt like I had turned something calming into something clinical. Right now I’m using a Casabrews CM5418. It has a pressure gauge, a proper steam wand, and adjustable shot volume, but nothing overly fancy.

What surprised me was how much better the whole thing felt again. I started pulling shots by feel, tasting as I went, enjoying the process, not just chasing consistency or crema porn. It made me realize that maybe good coffee isn't about perfection, but about presence.

Anyone else been through this cycle? Did stepping down or simplifying ever help you rediscover the joy? Do you think espresso should be about relaxing into the ritual, or about nailing the variables every single time?"
https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1lh3j6p/antique_peugot_coffee_grinderhow_to_use,Antique peugot coffee grinderhow to use,"Hi folks. I have a Peugot 1930s/1940s coffee grinder that works great. The grind adjustment is a nut mounted right below the crank handle you use hand turn for grinding. Very simple and opposite of Zassenhaus.

Push down on the nut (it's spring loaded). Hold it down and turn CLOCKWISE for fine grind. Adjust upward (Counter clockwise) for coarse. Easy Peasy.

Older Zassenhaus are the opposite. You turn the adjustment nut (not spring loaded) counter clockwise for finest grind and clockwise to get it coarser.

Eyeball the catcher drawer below to see your results early on or just a week or less of use and you'll be dialed in.

These old grinders are work horses, very easy to use and produce good coffee. This is specifically posted for folks going this route (lots out there off reddit) but on the Peugot, hard to find directions for the older models.  Cleaning it up, ran minute rise through it, wipe with some soap on a sponge, paper towel to dry, some sunshine and good to go.

I have disassembled the Zassenhaus and due to age and such that required using screwdriver , careful use at one point of a vice grip and vice to free the blades up but once it was apart, cleaned up nicely with light brillo (blades), soap and water, dry--reassemble. On the Zassenhaus, to clean the internal wood where the beans touched, fine sand paper worked wonders, bit of diluted vinegar , disinfected, soap water too, not too wet, good to go. Minute rice is fine for an initial clean on medium coarse. Once you have the feel of grinding, run again with minute rice on a fine grind. Works. Run some Aldi Beans through after---light roast or any other bad beans (will remove any rice residue you'r e worried about--or good beans if you're not cheap--throw that away....seasoned."

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1lfkrzm/bloom_envy_what_could_i_be_missing_or_doing_wrong,Bloom envy what could i be missing or doing wrong,"I primarily brew a daily V60 pourover and have gotten pretty good at it. I get my coffee from a Trade subscription, most of the time I prefer a light or light-medium roast. I grind the beans with a gen 1 Fellow Ode using gen2 burrs that I swapped in, usually on the absolute finest setting on the dial.

Whenever I see a video of some Youtuber making a pourover, whether it's Hoffman or whoever, they tend to have a really significant bloom where the coffee swells and domes up with tons of tiny bubbles. It's all very satisfying and \~aesthetic\~.

But I never seem to achieve this. Even with a brand new bag of beans from Trade. I know that bloom is the result of gasses being released from the ground beans and the amount that occurs is determined mostly by the freshness of the beans. On a good day my bloom will have a bit of bubbles but the surface of the bed of grounds in my V60 stays pretty flat - there's no swelling or doming of the coffee.

At the end of the day the cup of coffee is enjoyable and this is a pretty silly concern, but I can't seem to stop thinking about it and I'm mostly just curious if I'm actually missing out on even better-tasting coffee. I worry my less appealing bloom is actually a visual indicator that I'm missing out on its full flavor potential.

As far as I know I get new beans in the mail maybe a week after they've been roasted. Could I be wrong about how fresh my beans are? Or is there some other technique I should try to adjust to achieve that fancy dome-shaped bloom?"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1ldhtdd/does_anyone_else_prefer_less_uniform_grounds,Does anyone else prefer less uniform grounds,"I think I like my grounds less uniform/more fines and varying sizes. I think, in a pleasant way, it creates a more muddy taste. Coffee from a real nice grinder seems to make the coffee taste clearer, with brighter, more acidic, and watery flavors (understandbly in a good way for others, but bad to me). I like my coffee to have a bigger mouthfeel, more rich, dark, maybe earthy, nutty, chocolatey flavors. I think its important to distinguish that I don't like dark roasts. I extremely dislike the burnt popcorn taste of dark roasts.

Has anyone else who tried better grinders with more uniform grinds find that they lke the taste less? I understand it probably helps to bring out more delicate flavors which can help identify orgin, drying, and roasting characteristics. But I think I just want the biggest body/thickest mouthfeel. Anyone else know what I'm talking about?"

I’m only trying to communicate to my fellow Q graders out there, since there is a huge lack of information about what’s going to happen in September onward.

For those of us who passed in late 2022 (we also had to deal with the Flavoractiv chaos) and need to recertify now, simply passing the CVA class makes your Q active for 3 years, just like a calibration. Since there’s such an info black hole right now on expiration dates, I’ve been emailing with the SCA. I’ve been assured that the CVA will extend active Q status for 3 years from taking new class.

They said calibration was an old CQI requirement, but when I asked what will happen in 3 years to keep our statuses active, they didn’t have the information. I guess we will cross that bridge later."
https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1l74j0e/logistical_challenges_of_supplying_quality_coffee,Logistical challenges of supplying quality coffee,"This is a topic that's been somewhat discussed before, but quite not in the particulars.

We have a ski cabin we rent out (mostly just in the winter). When we bought the place we never intended on renting it, but then somewhat suddenly I got injured and was not working or skiing so I realized I should have other people use it so it wasn't just sitting idle costing me money. This background is important because we still use the cabin ourselves so our guiding principle is to make it a place we'd be happy staying.

The current coffee setup includes a Moccamaster Technivorm, Baratza Encore, electric kettle, french press, moka pot, and emergency back-up handgrinder. Works great for us when we bring beans, and we've gotten great feedback about the setup, but one couple was particularly chaffed we didn't at least offer ""cheap bad coffee"".

On principle I'd rather not supply such a thing, but the logistics of supplying decent quality coffee is what's stopped me from doing so this far.

I think it's important that it's both reasonably fresh and quantity controlled or else there will definitely be the guests that just take whatever they can home with them.

Here's the crazy ideas I'm kicking around:
A. Good instant - shelf stable and individual packages. Price per serving would be on the higher side for a bit of a handicapped end result, but it's something.

B. Mini freezer with sample bags - we have an owners closet where we could keep back-up bags. We'd need to get a freezer, so initial upfront cost would be higher, but the resulting product would be better and more affordable.

We also live about 2.5 hours away, so the restocking would be done by our cleaners. They are totally open to helping us by monitoring inventory and restocking either option, but it is something we want to be mindful of.

I’ve been just getting my feet wet in the coffee world — I used to be an instant coffee every-morning kind of person. But lately, I’ve been diving into brewing better, and I quickly realized how helpful a scale with a built-in timer could be after seeing everybody and their dogs using them on yt.

So I built one!

This is a 3D-printed coffee scale powered by an Arduino Nano, a load cell with an HX711 amplifier, and a little 128×64 OLED screen. It shows the weight in grams and includes a timer you can control with a single button.

I open-sourced the whole thing, from the Arduino code to the 3D printable model. If you're into DIY, homebrew gear, or just want to try building your own scale, check it out!

Would love any feedback or ideas to improve it — especially from more seasoned brewers. Thanks!"

There are 5 exams, all of which are straightforward. Two written exams to categorize flavor attributes, and a written extrinsic value exam. You don’t need to have prior knowledge of either of these things, it’s very intuitive. There are two cupping tests, of which you are graded on PROPER USE OF THE FORM ONLY. It is not a calibration, you don’t need to have scores correlating to others! In my class, there was defect spiking. However, mistaking the defect for a different one wasn’t an instant fail like with the Q. I haven’t taken the online test part yet, so I can’t attest to that.

There is in fact 2 nez practices, but it is not an exam. Even people who haven’t cupped in a while shouldn’t have trouble passing the class. Don’t worrry!"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1l4b7fk/eureka_mignon_doser_fix,Eureka mignon doser fix,"I recently bought my first grinder, an old 2008 mignon. It has the bottom dosing dial. Although time based, it is still nice to have. My grinder came with a broken doser, so it never stopped grinding untill i turned the grinder off. I feel like i should post how i fixed this so people can fix theirs too.

The problem is the blue rotating knob part - trimmer. It has to be replaced for a new one. If you dont feel comfortable soldering, you can also put the grinder into manual mode which grinds as long as the button is pressed - good when paired with single dose mods.

EITHER set the grinder to manual: Take the bottom off using the four screws and put a jumper connector - fifth picture - on the red header - circled in the last picture.

OR do what i did and keep the dosing function:

I bought a new 1Mohm 10mm linear trimmer for about 50 cents. The important things are the 10mm size, it being a linear type and having resistance range up to a milion ohms, or one Megaohm. I replaced it with one that needs a flat head screwdriver, which makes it a little more difficult to adjust, but if you find a knob version, go for it.

I bought the 1028G-1M , see fourth picture.

I unscrewed the grinders bottom cover (4 screws) to reveal the pcb, took a picture of the wires and unplugged them. I took the pcb out (2 screws) and soldered the old trimmer off, put the new one in and put it back together.

IF YOU WANT TO USE THE DOSING, YOU CANT USE THE RED JUMPER

Now it works!

Final note: If your mignon grinder grinds for about 2.8 seconds regardless of the knob position, the resistance is out of expected range. You either have the wrong trimmer or there is another electrical issue.

Hope this helps someone use these robust machines for a little longer."

Basically as said above, I was talking to my wife about the popularity of coffee and while we both had a few ideas, I remembered that legend about a pope blessing coffee after trying it and wanted to know what type of proclamation he would have released.

I use these three sources as ones I had hapharzdly found. Either way, I suddenly got the urge to dust of my research and primary sources finding skills and locate the origin of this story. I have since lost the original Wikipedia article I was using, probably coffee, but Pope Clement the VIII has a subsection detailing his blessing of Coffee in the year 1600 {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope\_Clement\_VIII#Coffee}

From here, I skimmed a variety of articles and a few books.

I mention only this one book because Mark Pendergrast is the only person to reference a book published in 1922 Titled ""About Coffee"" Written by William H. Ukers. { [https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/William-H-Ukers/dp/935403201X](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/William-H-Ukers/dp/935403201X) }

Because this book is so old and in Public Domain, I found a online copy and browsed through it. Because it is a Digital Copy I am unable to get the exact Page Number, however in Chapter 4, Page 5 I believe {In case anyone happens to have a Physical Copy of this book} I quote

 ""Shortly after coffee reached Rome, according to a much quoted legend, it was again threatened with religious fanaticism, which almost caused its excommunication from Christendom.""

On the Following Page I quote again

""Thus, whatever harmfulness its opponents try to attribute to coffee, the fact remains (if we are to credit the story) that it has been baptized and proclaimed unharmful, and a ""truly Christian beverage,"" by his holiness the pope.""

These quotes themselves are some of the only few items within this book that do not have some type of direct source or reference to another body of work for me to follow up on. This spat of research cost me about two hours of my time and I get randomly passionate about things being told correctly. So anyway, I was hoping if anyone else had a source older than this book from 1922 they could point me too, because I am genuinely curious where this legend came from.

Unfortunately while I have a variety of languages under my belt, Italian is not one of them, and so I do not know how I could E-mail someone in the Vatican for a reference to this story as well {As I am sure they could dig something up if someone had something.}

 Its getting late for me and so I hope someone else finds this mildly interesting or has another subreddit I could try asking this in too. Thanks!"

I’ve been brewing with a Moka pot for a while now and really enjoy the process of fine-tuning it. Lately though I’ve been thinking about trying pour over to change things up. While doing some research, I came across the added flexibility of immersion brewing, which led me to the V60 Switch — and now I’m even more curious.

What I’m wondering is: for those of you who have both, do you get as much satisfaction from pour over as you do from perfecting a Moka brew? I know the end result is quite different, but I’m really asking about the enjoyment of the process and end product.

Do you find it becomes a mood thing, choosing based on how you feel that day, or do you end up favouring one method over the other?

And I've been trying to recreate it ever since. It was italian style coffee: cappuccino, americano, macchiato, etc. All of them had a very strong distinct coffee flavor to them. But it wasn't bitter or overly sweet at all. When I say coffee flavor, I mean what you taste for example, when you bite into a chocolate covered espresso bean.

I do not have an actual espresso machine, just a moka pot. I use a Timemore C2S, and Lavazza Barista Espresso beans. However, all the coffee I make either just ends up strong/slightly bitter, overly sweet, or tasting like cooked milk. The closest I can get is when I add in condensed milk straight to the coffee from the moka pot. However, then it ends up just a bit too sweet. But the flavor is close-ish. I'm starting to wonder if that cafe added in a creamer? Because I find that it is rare to have coffee with such a strong distinct coffee flavor, but without it being overly sweet, burnt, or just tasting like hot milk."

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1kyeu4s/questions_on_qahwaarabic_style_coffee,Questions on qahwaarabic style coffee,"Dear r/Coffee

I'm honestly perplexed as to how little information there is on Arabic STYLE Coffee (not Arabica coffee bean species). I'm talking about that ultra light roast, almost darker than ""white-roast"", but less roasted than a traditional light roast coffee that people in the Arabian peninsula drink, particularly in Yemen and Saudi Arabia AKA Gulf/Emirati  Coffee. I have recently become very fascinated with it and have a bunch of questions on it and am seeking more information on it. Moreover, I would like to know what the coffee connoisseurs think about it, and how it falls in the coffee roast/taste/profile spectrum.

I will now continue to ask some questions and relay some of my thoughts about it:

Firstly, Qahwa just means Coffee in Arabic, and i'd argue that what we understand coffee to be today, that dark rich liquid, is not what Coffee started as. I believe coffee was first brewed in the middle east, and the form that they were drinking was much lighter, akin to what is drunk now and considered this Arabic Stye Coffee I talk about.

Now once again this is Arabic Style Coffee that typically is brewed with spices like Cardamom, Saffron, and/or Mastica, and I am not referring to the Arbica species of bean alongside Robusta, Liberica, etc. Every Arabic Style Coffee-drinking Arab Family has their own method for brewing this type of coffee that varies with how long they roast for, their grind size, spice mix, and cooking method/time.

Now my first question: there appears to be a very developed science of modern coffee, but there does not appear to be anything similar to this with Arabic Style coffee. Heck, I can't even find a single bag of Arabic beans that will yield that light, and not black, cup.

More questions:  Why did we start roasting beyond that Arabic Style roast level in the first place? What is the technical name for this level of roast? When does a roast that yields this tan/yellowish cup of coffee transform into that dark cup that we are familiar with? What is the effect of this light roast on caffeine content, as there is a lot of misinformation on the changes of caffeine with roasts

I'm curious to know what you all think!"

I’m exploring the idea of moving roasted coffee beans from one continent to another (let’s say from Central America to Europe). I’d love to hear from anyone who has experience or insights into this process.

Some specific questions I have:

* **Logistics:** What are the best shipping methods for roasted coffee beans over long distances? Do you recommend sea freight, air freight, or a mix depending on volume?
* **Packaging:** I understand roasted beans are usually shipped in **valve-sealed bags**. Any tips on specific bag types, packaging best practices, or brands that you trust?
* **Storage and freshness:** How do you ensure the beans stay fresh during transit (which can take weeks)? Do you use additional oxygen absorbers, desiccants, or other techniques?
* **Customs and import/export challenges:** Any advice on navigating the paperwork, tariffs, or regulations when importing coffee into different regions?
* **General advice and lessons learned:** Any major mistakes you’ve encountered or things you wish you’d known before starting?

Thanks a lot for any advice you can share. Looking forward to learning from your experiences!"

The paint on all their grinders seems really fragile. Does anyone know what paint colour this is? They suggested putting on any black-matte paint touch-up, but since it’s a matte finish, I want to make sure I’m applying the closest colour.

So far, I’ve considered Tamiya Acrylic XF-1 Flat Black and Tamiya XF-85 Rubber Matt Black, but I’m not sure if they’ll match exactly. Ideally, I’d take the top panel out and repaint the whole thing, but Weber’s website doesn’t show how to remove it, and there’s no YouTube video either.

It felt like a used unit or a wild lack of QC. The color variation on the panels of the grinder and display unit were also not as consistent as the previous unit I had on subscription.

I immediately sent an email to their CX team with photos, requesting an exchange.

Their response was a $20 store credit... if I kept the defected unit. I declined and asked to process an exchange.

I was then sent a follow up email bribing me with a whopping $50 store credit to keep the unit along with a screenshot of their return policy demanding a $60 restocking fee in order to process the exchange.

I'd say that improved my coffee taste by about 20%.

Today I decided to actually splurge and bought a $200 1zpresso K-ultra hand grinder to replace the $20 electric Cuisinart grinder I was using, and a digital scale. And that was like a 2,000% improvement in the taste of my coffee.... I'm in shock at how much a difference changing grinders and using grams made. I really felt so guilty buying this because I thought there was no way it would have such an impact on taste and I was just splurging for no reason on stuff only tiktok creators would use to make their setup look complicated and cool.

I guess I'd like to ask what other things are you all shocked that buying a premium version of wasn't just excessive and made a real difference."

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1ks5ti7/instead_of_wine_tasting_in_italy_youd_go_coffee,Instead of wine tasting in italy youd go coffee,"So I have perhaps an unusual question, but i feel like you all may have some interesting insight…

I have some health issues that have kept me from traveling for several years now. I’ve also had to stop drinking alcohol because of it…

I’m at a point where I’d like to test the waters with traveling again, though, and I thought it would be cool to have a coffee focus during the trip to some extent. One time, for example, I took a trip to Scotland and incorporated several whiskey tastings into the overall trip. The trip wasn’t just about whiskey, but there was a good deal of it throughout.

The things is, my health stuff involves a lot of dietary restrictions, and I can’t risk getting food poisoning or stomach issues. So, going to Central America and touring coffee farms, for instance, would be off the table for me. I’ve done some of that before, and it’s awesome, but I just currently can’t.

So I’m thinking more so like a tour of badass coffee shops throughout the trip, which brings to mind big cities with lots of third wave spots. I’m hoping for the trip overall, however, to involve more than just exploring a city, though. I’d love to incorporate some epic nature, too. Culture, etc.

What comes to mind for me are…

\- The Pacific Northwest in the US. Seattle and Portland would probably have a lot of everything I’m looking for.

\- Japan?

\- Spots in Australia and New Zealand

Hopefully you get where I’m going here. Not so much individual cities - more so bigger regions with a lot of great coffee throughout, plus a lot more to offer for a well rounded trip.

I know things like budget, etc, will dictate a lot, but right now I’m hoping to start with a list of places anywhere in the world.

Any ideas?"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1kqfr0d/how_i_imagine_the_people_who_label_the_flavor,How i imagine the people who label the flavor,"**| A Truly Fruitful Experience |**

It was a long morning; the kind that promises overexertion of the mind for even the simplest of tasks. The morning meeting had concluded and the torrent of Monday emails had been bushwhacked - nothing more to look forward to except for the rest of the dreaded workday. I was prepared for the siphoning of my life energies once more.

But, time and time again, I turn to the habit that keeps me and many other afloat: the ritualistic extraction of caffeine.

Not just any caffeine source however, no. Pedestrian chlorogenic acids and lipids dare not grace my esteemed palate. To truly set this day straight, I must, I require - nay - I demand only the most unique and thought provoking flavors from this holy caffeine source.

Today’s bean - Archetype: Ecuador; Finca Arashi Natural.

As the beans fall prey to my grinder, the aroma wafts into my allergy-stuffed nostrils, cutting past even the most stalwart nasal blockages. The excitement in me builds and bubbles, just as the kettle of hand-sourced, fluoride-filled city water bubbles, approaching the perfect temperature to extract the essences of the ground beans.

As careful as a surgeon operating on his patient, I evenly wet the grounds and extract the flavors in the carafe. Patient as my hand - I wait for the water to filter through and capture every detail of the ground beans.

Finally, it is poured. Carmel colored liquid fills my mug, the oils dance and swirl atop the frothing brew.

I take a sip; the steam coming off blinding my view such that my palate may see more clear:

Instantly - the rush of sweet berry wine assaults the tip of my tongue, its punctual entrance carving the way for the rest of the flavors to take hold. My eyes widen - what could possibly follow such a strong first impression? Milliseconds pass before the fullness of cherry covers the rest of my tongue, the contrast between the wine flavor and the cherry flavor coming fully into focus, their intricate dance leaving me in awe. The sensations linger on my tongue, as the finishing essence surprises me and takes hold - almond cookie. Almond cookies, freshly baked, linger on a few seconds after the liquid slides down my throat, warming my very soul and transporting me. It’s as if, I wasn’t even in my home at all, but bathed in a dawning sunbeam cast onto me from the window of a local bakery.

I sit there, stunned. That was only the first sip, too.

I look down and revere what is cupped in my hands; a truly bountiful and fruitful potion is in my possession this day.

I think to myself: this must be the preamble to a most bountiful and - fruitful - day."

This last week, I felt like I can no longer taste the coffee?! Not sure if it's my taste bud or the coffee beans. But I felt like I'm drinking slightly bittered thicker water. Or slightly acidic thicker water.
I drink Americano and pour overs.

So people start to not taste the coffee? My nose doesn't pick up that coffee house smell anymore either.
Beans are always rested for a week and usually finished within 3 weeks of roasting.

I can still taste/smell food just fine though. Pasta, pizza, noodle in soup.. etc."

But now I keep hearing people talk about finding the best drip coffee in town. I always thought drip coffee was what people drank at home when they didn't have an espresso machine. For example, when I was a kid, we had an old-style filter coffee machine, but we didn't choose it. It was just what we had at the time.

So I'm confused. Why is drip coffee suddenly cool? Is it actually better in some way, or is this just a trend? Should a person to consider buy a device for that, if they have, for example, $1000 budget for their home setup?"

To make whipped cream for an iced coffee you need powdered sugar, heavy whipping cream and some vanilla syrup. Instead of vanilla syrup if i use “ toasted marshmallow” coffee syrup…would that make the whipped cream taste like marshmallow fluff? Would i be successful in creating a marshmallow whipped cream?

Similarly if i replaced the vanilla with cinnamon or pumpkin spice syrup would that result in cinnamon or pumpkin spiced whipped cream?

I’m wondering because i’m thinking maybe the whipped cream wouldn’t whip properly if i add liquids such as syrup into it? Maybe it would be too dense and not whippy? I want to make my iced coffees more creative than just a simple vanilla, caramel, hazelnut flavoured latte. I was thinking of infused whipped creams instead?

Do you think an infused cold foam with syrup would be a better idea than whipped cream?

I have a Sage Oracle coffee machine. (I think it's known as the Breville Oracle in the states).

I've had it for 5 years and am very happy with the espresso machine part, but the grinder has always annoyed me a bit, and it's recently packed up.

I've fancied a single dose ""zero retention"" grinder for a number of years, and now that the grinder portion of my machine has died, I've got an excuse to buy a new bit of kit.

So. I almost exclusively drink unsweetened milky drinks. I like chocolatey notes, and mostly use the red brick blend beans from Square Mile. I don't do filter coffee or aeropress. I believe that means conical burrs are fine for me. I won't bother changing up my burrs, so not fussed about spending more for that option.

I could justify spending up to about £600.

As far as I can tell, I'll be really happy with a Niche Zero, but it's been out for many years now, so I'm just interested to see if there's any worthy competitor that it's worth checking out.

This may be especially pertinent if you wonder what impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the industry (hint: not a good one). Remember to keep supporting your favorite coffee businesses if you can - check out the weekly deal thread and the coffee bean thread if you're looking for new places to purchase beans from.

Industry folk, feel free to answer any questions that you feel pertain to you! However, please let others ask questions; do not comment just to post ""I am _______, AMA!” Also, please make sure you have your industry flair before posting here. If you do not yet have it, contact the mods.

While you're encouraged to tie your business to whatever smart or charming things you say here, this isn't an advertising thread. Replies that place more effort toward promotion than answering the question will be removed.

Please keep this thread limited to industry-focused questions. While it seems tempting to ask general coffee questions here to get extra special advice from ""the experts,"" that is not the purpose of this thread, and you won't necessarily get superior advice here.

I’m pretty new to coffee and trying to figure out what I like in terms of flavor profiles, roast levels, etc. I make coffee at home (Aeropress) and only drink about one cup per day. The problem is that even a 12oz bag of beans lasts me nearly a month, so it’s going to take forever to sample a decent range of coffees.

It’s not practical for me to go to coffee shops frequently, and more than one cup a day (or any coffee past 11am) messes with sleep. What’s the best way to quickly try a lot of different coffees - ideally from local roasters so that I can find locally available favorite beans?Are there sample packs, subscriptions, or other methods you’d recommend?

I’m in the CA East Bay (Oakland/Berkeley/etc) if that is relevant."

My current obsession is Ethiopian naturals through a VST basket on a Linea Mini. I let the pressure ramp be imperfect. I want the crema to fracture like a distorted sine wave.

I know that probably reads like nonsense to most baristas. But espresso, for me, isn’t clarity, it’s texture. Tactile dissonance.

- Peru Café del Valle
  Region: Utcubamba & Luya
  Altitude: 2,300 meters
- Arabica Brazil Catuai (lcatu)
  Region: Santos, Brazil
  Altitude: 1,200 meters

Is it common for these types of coffees to have limited information available, or are they simply less popular? If anyone could point me in the right direction or share any insights, I’d be very grateful!

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1ka57cd/losing_my_mind_cannot_get_any_proper_brightness,Losing my mind cannot get any proper brightness,"Dear community, i feel like i'm going deeper and deeper into a spiral of pour over-desperation - I cannot get any sort of perceivable brightness, acidity of generally fresh and light flavours from my coffee, even when using beans that notes lime, citrus, green apple, anything the likes. Whenever i brew them, i always get this sort of muted 'roundness' that is more like a sweet chocolate, and not acidic or bright in any way. I've tried a yellow honey Costa Rica that was described as juicy and citrusy, tried a washed peruvian that described green apple and citrus, and now i just bought another washed ethiopian from a different roaster, that noted lime and peach. And they all taste kinda the same?

I absolutely adore a bright and fresh coffee, and i lot that tangy acidity that is found in citrus and green fruits.

Help me fix this, please!

My setup so far:

\- zp6 grinder and a K-ultra, no luck with either

\- Cafec Abaca filter

\- Fellow Stagg EGK

\- Demineralized water with lotus drops added, used both the ""light and bright"" and the ""Simple and sweet"" recipe

\- Hario switch, used as a V60, only keeping the switch closed for the first 10 seconds during the bloom to make sure that all grounds are wet

I am very well versed in coffee and pour over in general, and feel like i have a lot of experience, but i've tried absolutely everything to fix this, but nothing seems to give.

Tried every grind setting on both the ZP6 and k-ultra, from the extreme fine to extreme coarse, tried every temp of water, from 80 to 100 degrees, tried lots of agitation and no agitation, long blooms and short blooms, different water recipes, drinking it hot and cold after brewing etc etc.

Please help me, i just want to feel the battery acid eat away my enamel, and i've spent to much on beans that end up not really tasting very good. The only time i've really felt some good acidity is if i buy some washed Kenya SL28.

Thanks for the help"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1k9wafd/impact_of_freezing_coffee_on_sweet_spot,Impact of freezing coffee on sweet spot,"This is such a specific question, but one that I imagine other folks have interest in understanding better.

I brew exclusively light and ultralight roasts, using an Aeropress and a flat burr grinder (unimodal burrs) to push clarity and flavor separation.

After resting my coffees, I find they tend to all shift coarser at a predictable pace, usually around 5 microns every week or so. (I am incredibly spoiled to be able to make adjustments this fine!)

One factor that I've never quite figured out is predicting how freezing impacts that ""sweet spot"" shift. Sometimes it seems to not impact anything — for instance, I  rested two coffees for the suggested 14 days, then froze for only a week before using. They are behaving fairly similar to a coffee I didn't freeze.

One coffee I froze for 2 months in February, however, surprised me by being muted and astringent. It's from the same roaster, same roast profile, same freezing protocol (do not open, wait 14 days, put in freezer, thaw night before use, open and use), but had no distinct flavors in spite of some great mouthfeel. I tried a couple settings before hypothesizing it was notably overextracted compared to its fellow coffees.

I read somewhere about the possibility of ""sweet spot shift"" happening in the freezer, but at a very slow pace, where 1 month in the freezer is similar to 2-3 days aging. So over the past couple days, I've experimented with settings I normally don't use until a couple weeks into a bag, and I'm getting much more genuine flavor. I am surprised I had to go as coarse as I did, though.

As my experiments continue, I'm curious who else has experimented with this!"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1k9hrme/baratza_encore_clogging_issue,Baratza encore clogging issue,"I bought a used Baratza Encore a few months ago and it's a great little machine. I've had a few clogs where the chute got backed up, and an issue with inconsistent grind after reassembling the outer burr ring incorrectly, so I'm familiar with the parts around the burr.

This clog is a bit different. It seems to be creating a compact disk of grounds underneath the outer burr ring, which prevents any coffee from actually going down the chute.

I disassembled, cleaned with a wire brush, used a can of compressed air to fully blow out every crevice from any remaining grounds, and re-assembled. I'll get about 3-4 seconds of normal output before it stops again, and the compacted grounds are stuck again. [Here's a picture](https://imgur.com/a/kTsk5gz)

That brown ring of compacted coffee around the burr is what I keep finding when I open it up, which I haven't really seen before. I'm using Trader Joe's medium roast beans, which don't appear to be overly oily so I don't suspect that's the issue; I've ground much darker/oilier beans without too much trouble before.

Any other troubleshooting ideas?

EDIT: For anyone experiencing a similar issue in the future, it appears that my paddle wheel has lost all it's paddles. Not sure when that happened, but I have a [replacement](https://www.baratza.com/en-us/product/paddle-wheel-with-felt-ring-sp0100803) on the way and that should resolve the issue."

I wanted to share a recent experience that not only introduced me to roasting but the primary motive was to save a bag of beans.  I recently bought a Hairo hand mill after my electric mill died. I do love this little hand mill. Soon after, I bought a bag of Colombian beans (I live in Colombia). The beans were so hard and dense it was almost impossible to grind them in my hand mill. Also the taste profile was very citrus and lemon forward, more than I cared for. My research indicated that high elevation beans roasted lightly will be hard and dense, and that was the case with these,  I gave up on these after just one cup.

After reading about roasting beans at home, I decided to see if I could simply roast these beans a little more. I pan roasted half a cup or so, I heard some of the cracking that I had read about and I roasted until they were a full shade darker. After 20 hours of allowing them to de-gas, I tried them this morning. First, they were much easier to grind. But even better, the taste profile changed and brought out more bitter-sweet chocolate, for a more balanced taste to my liking. I have never heard of further roasting coffee that is purchased roasted, but in my case it worked out great."

Until now, I had only tried Starbucks Whole Bean selections from places such as Guatemala, Tanzania, Sumatra, etc. I thought I'd try something more unique and ""special"" this time around, and I bought some ""Sidama Bombe Natural Ethiopian"" coffee beans from a well-reputed local roaster. I tried this coffee and I have to say it was *different*. I found it rather bitter, and missing the characteristic rich coffee aroma I've become used to whenever I ground coffee beans. The beans were also light-brown, as opposed to the rich dark brown coffee colour I'm more familiar with. I even wondered if I had got ""green coffee"" instead of roasted coffee, but the bag clearly said ""roasted"".

I'm aware that there are ""washed"" and ""natural"" roasts, so I wonder if such bitterness is a feature of the ""natural"" roast? Or maybe it's a feature of this specific type of Ethiopian coffee (Sidama)? Thoughts? How different would this ""Sidama Bombe Natural Ethiopian"" coffee be from, say, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe Aricha Washed roast? I'm curious about trying other Ethiopian coffees types/regions, but this first try has been rather underwhelming for me.

EDIT: Thank you so much everyone for the feedback. I've realized that I still have SO MUCH to learn (I didn't know that the brewing type would alter coffee flavour, for example!). I'll have to do A LOT of reading before I continue to experiment!"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1k0gour/a_barista_that_cant_smell,A barista that cant smell,"Hi! I’ve been a barista for 7 months now, and yes, I can't smell. I actually found out when I was a kid. We had an activity in school that involved using our sense of smell, and that’s when I realized I couldn’t smell anything at all.

Fast forward to now—I applied as a barista at a well-known coffee shop, and I got hired. On my first day, there was this kind of culture or practice they do, like a coffee tasting session with the manager and barista trainer. While we were doing that for the first on my first day, I started to feel guilty because I realized I never mentioned during my application that I can’t smell.

I’ve kept it to myself since then and ppretending that I can smell. (Yes, I can do that)

Now, as a barista, I mostly just make drinks or just in POS, so not being able to smell hasn’t been much of an issue. But when it comes to the deeper or core side of the job—like getting to know the different kinds of coffee, sense of smell is actually really important. One of the implrtant parts of understanding coffee is being able to smell and know it.

So now I’m wondering… should I tell them? I’ve been thinking about this for a while, and it’s starting to bother me again because I’m about to perform a coffee tasting soon.

What should I do?"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1k07ph2/exceptionally_uninteresting_cupping_experience,Exceptionally uninteresting cupping experience,"I have decided to try cupping after buying a new coffee to improve my palette and have an interesting time, but at least from my (newbie) experience it felt exceptionally disappointing. I followed the Hoffman tutorial with 10g of coffee to 166g of water on ~200ml cups. I tried two coffees with very different origins; One washed Ethiopian coffee at a 2000m altitude with fruit and plant descriptions, and a natural processed brazilian coffee at a 1000m altitude with chocolate, caramel and stonefruit descriptions. When tasting the two tasted basically identical? All I could really pick up on was that the Brazilian had a slight meat-like note. The brews just kinda tasted bad too, I was delighted to finally just drink some water in the end (though that's a different problem I have throughout all my brews). I don't really know what I'm supposed to expect here. Should I just make it stronger with more coffee? Should I do it with taste notes in mind? Is it actually that subtle and I'm disappointed at the normal outcome? I'm very new so I have basically no idea on what is supposed to be a good experience with this. I kinda believe everyone has a coffee they'd enjoy but it seems I'm really struggling finding a difference between two in the first place."

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

Now I’ve gone down the rabbit hole of fruit forward coferments and having been getting bags that are pretty fresh (<7 days after roasting).

I’ve seen instructions from the roasters recommending rest times. But I don’t really understand it or the effect it has on the been. Need someone to ELI5 this one for me.

+ why rest your beans?
+ what effect does resting your beans have on coffee quality or flavor development?
+ why do coffees have different rest times?
+ is resting worth it? In other words - is this a 2% improvement vs a 20% improvement?

I’ve been a specialty coffee barista in NYC for 5 years and I’m having the hardest time breaking out of my role as a barista and going deeper into the industry.

Coffee is my passion and I’m resolved to be in this life for the long haul. Eventually I’d like to start my own business. The problem is I’m talented and knowledgeable enough to keep getting promoted to assistant manager - which I’ve now done at three different shops. But every time I apply for a more senior role I seem to get passed over.

I’m constantly reading books about coffee science and I would say I definitely know more than the average fourth wave barista at this point. What can I do to set myself apart and get an opportunity at the next level? Should I get my Q rating? Am I being impatient?

Would love advice from anyone who has advanced to the next tier of this industry. How did you do it?

Thanks in advance."

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1jpxtl9/main_types_of_coffee_brewing_classification,Main types of coffee brewing classification,"I know this question has been asked to death, but honestly, I never found a clear explanation on main types of brewing and their subsets; there were mostly all the methods thrown together.

Below, I'll share my take with examples, please correct this if it's wrong or share your take on real main methods of brewing:

1. Drip (Filter): Pour-over, Auto-drip, etc.

2. Espresso: Americano, Lungo, Moka Pot, Cappuccino, Mochaccino, Latte, etc.

3. Immersion: French press, Cold brewing, etc.

4. Boiled: Turkish, Greek, Arabic, etc.

Some say moka pot is in the same category as epresso, some say it's different and should be classified under Percolation.

What are your thoughts?"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1jp4ryw/just_knowingly_had_my_first_cup_of_natural,Just knowingly had my first cup of natural,"I've been drinking fresh, washed, coffee of various roast levels delivered via Trade for a few years now. I left my preferences wide open (roast level, flavor of the coffee, etc...) so I'm used to tasting a wide range of flavors, but the hallmarks are always acidity and a strong/bold flavor that pretty much everyone associates with ""coffee"".

I bought a Gaggia Classic Pro Evo (wrong sub, I'm aware haha) about a month ago, and decided to buy a bunch of different roast levels to try out since my (1:2) shots were largely sour or highly acidic. All of them are washed, but when I was searching for a light roast I came upon a natural processed Ethiopian coffee, and I remembered everyone raving about how different they are compared to most other beans, so I gave it a shot (heh).

I just brewed a cup now using a 1:14 ratio with my Weber Bird and a brew temp of 190F *and holy crap what a difference there is in flavor*. I drank black tea for decades before I switched over to coffee and it reminds me of a strong, quality, black tea. I normally drink my coffee with milk and a drop of sucralose, but this was so tasty *that I happily drank it black*. Naturally processed coffee may be my new go-to instead of washed.

I remembered having a bag delivered about 6-9 months ago that was so different than anything else I had before, but didn't know it was most likely a naturally processed bean at the time since I didn't have the bag handy. My dad doesn't like coffee at all and was the one that I would always drink tea with, growing up. I prepared the *unknown* cup as I normally would and told him to try it and guess what it was (coffee or tea) and he guessed that it was some sort of black tea as well. After I told him it was coffee he was surprised, but didn't want a cup of it hahaha

Just for reference sake, these are the beans I bought (company - name - roast level - variety if specified), all are washed except for the Ardi:

* Equator Coffee - Ardi Natural - Light - Sidama Heirloom - Single Origin (the natural one, as the name implies)
* Good Citizen - Dos Santos - Medium - Mixed (most likely)
* Bird Rock - Monkey Bite Espresso - Medium - Mixed (most likely)
* Good Citizen - Hold Fast - Dark - Mixed
* Orens Coffee NYC - Italian Roast - Extra Dark - Mixed"

Oat milk makes my heart rate go up and it also has an oatmeal flavor that I’m not a fan of. I know, I am very picky with these alternatives! While they are great on their own or with other things, I just don’t care for them in coffee. I love whole milk in my coffee, so I’ve been settling for 2% lately. Is there any low calorie alternatives anyone would recommend? Or should I just accept the calories in the 2% and cut elsewhere."

I am wanting to upgrade and purchase my first Official Espresso Grinder. I have a budget of \[$200\] & \[$800\]. I have seen Hybrids like Niche, Timemore, & DF64 Gen 2. I see many videos of each Grinder. However, I can't seem to pinpoint a Grinder I would like to commit to. As I hear many Pros and Cons but can't seem to have a final decision. I don't mind if the Grinder is an Espresso + Pour Over Hybrid Grinder, as that's what most Grinders come in nowadays it seems. That being said, I have had my eyes set on Niche for simplicity bur curious if it's still worth it in 2025, but also have my eyes set on the DF64 Gen 2 or even the DF54 as I've heard many reviews on the Flat Burr Profile, upgrade potential on the burrs, and the ease on the Grind Dial. I have also seen the Timemore 064s. I don't know the whole science between variable / adjustable RPM such as 500-800 RPM. WHAT I AM WANTING: I just want great tasting Espresso from either Conical or Flat Burr, easy cleaning of the Inner Grinder, ease on workflow, and if the Grinder does well on Pour Over that's a plus. SIDE NOTES: Not sure if this will help my case, but I use Medium Roast Beans mainly. I make 4-8 cups a day. I do not mind the noise of the Grinder if it's a bit loud, I say that as I've seen complaints from DF64 Owners. Hope this helps to whoever reads this."

Wanting to improve, I bought an economic manual coffee grinder and in the istruction is said that you are not supposed to wash it with water but only with the brush that was included in the bundle.

I have also seen that almost everyone agrees with that but I could not find an explanation of why water should not be used

Given this, how we are supposed to clean the grinder? Using the brush, particles of coffee remain inside the grinder and I know that residuals of coffee are subject to oxidation and can result in rancid-tasting coffee

In case it matters the grinder that I use have a ceramic grinding mechanism and i brew coffee mostly with a moka pot

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1jn0k36/psa_exposing_df64coffeecom_shady_business,Psa exposing df64coffeecom shady business,"Hi all,

Before I start let me preface a few things:

1. I'm just sharing my experience, which may be a one-off. My hope if that you think twice about ordering from this dealer.
2. This is not a reflective of the quality of DF grinders, which I can't comment on. As far as I know [df64coffee.com](http://df64coffee.com) is just a retailer and doesn't produce the grinders.
3. I'm creating a throwaway to share this, in case people from this company frequent this subreddit. It would be pretty easy for them to identify me from the content I'm about to post.

\---

Here is an imgur post with all my email interactions with them, it's a long read but I **really** recommend going over it if you're thinking about ordering from them: [https://imgur.com/a/exposing-df64coffee-com-shady-business-practices-OMC3Qin](https://imgur.com/a/exposing-df64coffee-com-shady-business-practices-OMC3Qin)

Here's the **not-so-TLDR** version (real TLDR below):

\- I ordered a DF64 Gen2 in the beginning of February. I decided ordering from them as reviews were postive and they had a much cheaper price than any German retailer (by about 50EUR when including shipping). Moreover, they state no tax to Europe.

\- The way this ""No tax to Europe"" system works in reality is: you pay any import taxes and other customs duties and then they reimburse you. However, and here's the kicker, they want you to submit false information to the customs office so they have to reimburse less money. **In my case they wanted me to submit a value of 49 SGD (about 34EUR) on a 392 EUR order.** Which I refused to do.

\- After 1 month, and no status updates on DHL tracking I reached out to DHL who had no record of it entering the system. I started getting worried it just got lost and requested the shipment of another grinder, and then later, an order cancellation and a full refund, which they refused. At this point they accused me of already having received the grinder, but fortunately it was very easy to refute and they had to retract that. Coincidentally or not, a few days after my cancellation request the DHL status was updated and I finally got a delivery date.

\- 1 month and a half after the order was created, the grinder arrived. I paid 99EUR in import taxes and customs duties. **Fortunately, they did a partial refund of 76EUR**, but refuse to refund the remaining amount.

\- I never used the grinder and immediately got rid of it. Having that around the house is just a reminder of this ordeal.

**TLDR**: Although they say ""No tax to XYZ country/region"" on their website, that's just a hook. You'll have to pay import taxes, and they push you to submit false information to the customs office.

Really hope some of you already have experience with it.

Firstly I am wondering what these two components, which you can see in my second picture are for. I can't find any information on the internet and since the manufacturer Joy Resolve is closed, it is impossible to get a solution from the company.
Are they important for using the device? Pretty sure the Barisieur doesn’t blow up if these are not in the right place but I am still curious where they might fit.

And secondly I wanted to reset the Barisieur with the „reset button“, which is no button but a hole (as you can see in my third picture). So how can I press it?

My main focus is brewed coffee since I don't have an espresso machine, nor is personally my favorite, but I believe that this could be useful por espresso as well.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1jj2bon/cascara_is_there_such_a_huge_difference_between,Cascara is there such a huge difference between,"I recently started to drink Cascara, the coffee husk infusion. I was acquainted to it at a local roaster that had Costa-Rican husks and it was sweet-mapley. I really enjoyed it. Then, I ordered the Finca-Deborah from Kawa (Panama Geisha), which was absolutely amazing.

Now, I ordered a different one, from Peru. It was cheaper (Kawa didn't have theirs in stock) and I hoped it would be the same. It tasted... well.. awful. Not the same as the previous two.

I know I can expect variance, just like the beans themselves, but is it known that some types are undrinkable and some are tasty?

Edit: went to see the roaster today. While I used 15 grams for 250 grams of water in Kawa's, this roaster recommended 5 grams per cup. It tastes way better now."

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1jigxmh/is_expensive_coffee_just_overrated,Is expensive coffee just overrated,"I'm Colombian, and unlike the coffee my country exports, the one consumed locally has always been said to be of poor quality—over-roasted and full of defective beans (pasilla). All my life, I've been drinking cheap supermarket coffee, which costs around $2 to $4 USD. I had always heard that high-quality coffee was incomparable to the cheap kind, and my curiosity was eating me alive. So, I went to a coffee farm that produces 100% organic coffee with several certifications, including some from the European Union, Japan, Korea, China, Rainforest Alliance, Bird Friendly, etc.

I bought two half-pound bags—one of Bourbon Honey coffee and the other of Geisha Honey. The local coffee farmer sold them to me for about $40 USD. When I got home, I was really excited. As soon as I opened the bags, the aroma was incredibly delicious, with notes of chocolate, cocoa... and soon my kitchen was filled with that pleasant scent. Even more excited, I used my drip coffee maker with a filter.

And when the moment of truth arrived, I took my first sip and… Mmmm, was it disappointing? I mean, the taste was fine, but I didn’t find much difference compared to the over-roasted cheap coffee I usually buy. It was just… meh. At first, I thought I had messed up the water-to-coffee ratio, so I brewed another batch, but the result was the same. The taste wasn’t significantly different.

I must admit that the aroma is a thousand times better than the cheap coffee I usually buy, but the taste left a lot to be desired. It was good, but for the price, I felt disappointed.

Any recommendations? Is my palate too used to cheap coffee to notice the difference? Was the issue with the brewing method? Or is expensive coffee just overrated?"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1j9p2vq/question_about_cold_brew_ratios,Question about cold brew ratios,"So my boss at an Asian Cafe purchased 5 pds of coffee to turn into coldbrew and was told by roaster to brew a 1:1 ratio for a super concentrated to be able to Dilute later.

I used to be a baristas and am an avid home immersion and percolation brewer for years and regularly use Hoffman method for French press. I know he mentions as the grounds sit on bottom, they extract less because the molecules are more packed snd rhe water loses strength to be to extract more, hence him mentioning it doesn't matter the total brew time at that point because you get dimishing returns.

So here's my main question: is there any disadvantage,during the brew, to using a 1:1 ratio, outside it being very concentrated snd needing more water/cream to add after? Or do you get the same rate of extraction (my thoughts are a 1:3-1:6 has a heavier total mass which may affect the total extraction yield). Anyone have numbers or experience to back up a 1:1 ratio over let's say a 1:2 - 1.6? Thanks for your time!"

To my surprise I don’t like it giving I don’t like coffee with sweetener. But now thinking this could work with others flavors.

I wonder, have you had this experience of having added things to your drink or food without noticing and end up liking or disliking? Did you end up creating a masterpiece of a drink?

Some beans don't clog at all, and the very next bag clogs with every single pour. Some bags pour brilliantly for the first cup, then the next day it clogs, and will clog for the remainder of the bag. Some just clog out the gate. I have tried different grind sizes but even getting to ""large pebble"" size it still manages to clog; the coffee just tastes worse. All I can conclude is that the beans are bad, and I should toss them, even if I paid $20-40 for 200g. It's really disappointing and frustrating.

I have tried nearly everything I can think of and I still don't know why this happens .

* I gave up my Hario hand grinder and got the Ode V1 grinder
* I got the SSP Red Speed burrs
* I switched to Hario V60
* I changed filters
* I switched back to the Melita filters shown here
* I got a vacuum canister
* I rested my beans
* I didn't rest my beans
* I have tried different beans
* I've tried every grind size from dust to large pebble
* I've tried different water temps.
* I use filtered water
* I got the Fellows pour over kettle

Short of living in a hermetically sealed, humidity controlled bubble, or wasting $100s finding bags with ""magic beans"" I have no idea how to fix this.

Does anyone know what I am doing wrong?

The photos show two consecutive pours of Coffee Collective DK beans. One was with my grinder set to 6, the other at 8.5. (I have the burrs just buzzing each other at zero). Both pours bloomed nicely at first, then clogged after about 90ml, then stopped. The coffee was nasty in both cases.

[Grinder on \\""6\\"", clogged, about a 4-5 min total extaction time. Tastes like crap. ](https://preview.redd.it/2v5tqoxvkrme1.jpg?width=6144&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=35b936746e77f8f9f2289e2a967ae82cd1189af4)

[Grinder on \\""8.5\\"". Grinds were clearly too large. Still clogged, even though I didn't see obvious excessive fines.

I’ve enjoyed amazing coffees from specialty shops for a couple of years now, and understand a few things about production processes and brewing (at least in theory ha). I always saw it as a treat that I enjoyed outside of my home, but with a lack of specialty coffee around me, I recently started brewing myself. I currently have a French press and portable espresso maker on hand (one that you fill with hot water, don’t think it’s very good to control variables). I enjoy the French press for now, as it’s pretty straight forward, but still allows to play around with the recipe to some extend through grind, brew time and ratio.

One thing I’m trying to understand is how to select coffees, and once selected, brew for a tasty cup. I understand taste is subjective, however, I’m interested in people’s thought process of translating flavour notes into their brewing approach!"

My wife and I since inception of the keurig we’ve been almost exclusively drinking coffee from our keurig. We are drinking between the both of us 4-5 pods of coffee a day which was adding up significantly over time but was worth it due to the convenience.

I recently purchased the Braun Multiserve Coffee maker and boy is the flavour of the coffee night and day but, I bought a bag from Starbucks had them grind it and paid 19.99 CAD for it and after now 2 pots of coffee the bag is half empty… the main reason for the purchase was to save money on coffee but if I’m spending $40 a week on coffee I might just return the coffee maker.

My friends always say that a cup of coffee for them is like $0.05 - $0.10 where as in this case it’s looking like $1.50. Am I doing something wrong? Did I purchase the wrong coffee? I’m using the recommended amount as per instructions of my coffee maker.

Also side note… it says to use 10 scoops of coffee in the basket (using the silicone mesh one) and it overflows. Is this because Starbucks grinded it too fine?

Any advise on how I can fix this problem?  Sadly no coffee machine technicians where I am located so I'm hoping maybe someone can help me do this remotely?

I have been drinking instant coffee my whole life because real coffee isn't as available in my country. But since the last 1-2 years I have been more serious about coffee and brought a coffee machine a few days ago and found out some rare places where you can order ground coffee from. The machine is the cheapest because I am a broke university student, and I am just dipping my toes and don't wanna spend a lot of money on coffee just yet.

Now, the instant coffees used to have a much denser and foamy texture irregardless of milk and sugar. Whereas this ground coffee seems much lighter with almost a water level consistency. Is this normal? I'm fine if it is normal. Or is there something wrong with my machine?"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1ivl0y3/why_are_flat_whites_in_north_america_served_in_a,Why are flat whites in north america served in a,"Although I know there's some debate, I believe the flat white was invented in Australia. Not that it was anything revolutionary. I know it basically as a smaller and stronger version of a latte, served in a ceramic cup, usually the same size and same strength (although sometimes 2 ristretto instead of 2 full shots) as a cappuccino but with less foam. That's what it is for me as an Aussie, at least, although I'm no coffee expert so maybe I'm misimformed about the exact differences.

But why when I order a flat white in the US do I get it in a small glass? Is it just to make a rarer/perceived specialty item appear more special/unique? I was wondering if it was just a New York thing since I live here now, but when I went to specialty cafes in Mexico City it was served the same way.

I mean it's not a big deal. It's interesting to see regional interpretations. Others might find it strange that in Australia a latte is often served in a glass. Just curious how the flat white became what it is here."

Here is my process:

1. CLEAR the catch and you don’t hear any beans grinding. It should be a nice whirl sound

2. PUMP the lid a few times to create suction

3. KNOCK on the sides of the body – left, right, and front

4. ROCK on the counter, so the foot knocks on the bottom this will get any remaining grinds out

5. PUMP again for good measure

That should do it and release all of your grinds!

It is a very strong coffee which you usually drink if you need to stay up all night and study (that's why of the name). So to prepare this coffee you need to have a moka (the typical Italian coffee maker) and with that you make a normal coffee. Once it's ready you pour it in a cup and cool it down a little. Then you pour that coffe back in the moka instead of the water. Then you prepare the rest of the moka normally (if you really want to exaggerate you can also but a little bit of butter inside the coffee powder, this will make it even stronger) then once the coffee is out you drink it all and it is assured you will be vibrant for at least 4 to 5 hours in the night ready to study. It will have a very strong taste but don't add to much sugar if not your heart will explode haha.
I've heard of stories of guys repeating the process for a third time but I think its bit too much.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1ids3uw/my_glitch_coffee_experience_and_thoughts_on,My glitch coffee experience and thoughts on,"**The Story**

My wife and I recently visited Japan on our way to a destination wedding. As a budding coffee enthusiast, I had one Tokyo café high on my list—Glitch Coffee, a well-known specialty coffee roaster. Unfortunately, when we arrived, we were met with a long line. After waiting for about five minutes, it was clear we’d be standing there for the better part of an hour. With limited time in Tokyo, we decided to move on to our next planned stop. While I was disappointed, it didn’t take away from an incredible day in a city unlike any other I’ve experienced as a Westerner.

Due to our itinerary, we couldn’t fit in another visit to Glitch. A few days later, I flew out to meet up with the other groomsmen for the bachelor party in another country, while my wife stayed behind to join the bridesmaids in Japan for their bachelorette party. She spent an extra day in Tokyo before heading to Osaka with the group.

Then, to my surprise, the very next day I got a notification that our shared credit card had been used at Glitch!

My wonderful, loving wife had made the trip back, braved the line, and not only tried some of their coffee but also picked up two jars to bring home for me. One of them is what I brewed today.

 

**The Coffee**

This particular coffee, grown in Nicaragua, is of the Geisha variety, known for its tea-like profile. Geisha is a rare coffee that produces significantly lower yields compared to more common varieties. This specific batch was grown at Los Alpes Farm in the Nueva Segovia region of Nicaragua and even won the 2023 Cup of Excellence for the country.

Unlike most modern coffee, which is washed-processed, this one was naturally processed, meaning the beans were dried inside the coffee cherry rather than being de-pulped from the cherry before drying. Neither process is inherently better, but natural processing typically results in fruitier flavors, whereas washed beans highlight more of the coffee’s inherent characteristics.

Glitch roasted these beans to a light roast, with jasmine tea, grape, and floral as their tasting notes. And yes, my dear wife spent $53.87 for just 50g of these beans—which comes out to $26.94 per the 25g used in the cup I brewed.

 

**The Brew**

I brewed this coffee using a 1:16 ratio of beans to water (25g to 400g) with my OXO 8-cup coffee maker. As it was brewing, I was immediately hit with a sweet, tea-like aroma.

After letting it cool slightly, I took my first sip and was blown away. The jasmine tea notes were immediately present, followed by a slight tartness of grape in the middle, and ending with a floral aftertaste. Wow. I was genuinely impressed that every single note from the roaster’s tasting description was clearly distinguishable.

While I normally drink my coffee black, I have no doubt that even someone who typically adds cream and sugar would enjoy this one straight. It truly tasted like no other coffee I’ve had before.

 

**Was It Worth It?**

$27 for one cup? Maybe? If you factor in the unique experience and the sentimental value of my wife’s effort, then absolutely. But based on price alone? No.

Specialty coffee is a game of diminishing returns, and I’ll admit this crossed the point where you’re paying exponentially more for marginal improvements. In fact, the other jar my wife brought back was another Geisha variety, but from Colombia, which cost $7.56 per 25g—and I actually liked that one more. It had notes of grapefruit and ginger that resonated better with my palate.

Both were amazing, but in hindsight, there was no real need to splurge on ultra-expensive beans. That said, I loved the experience, and for that, I have no regrets.

If you’re ever in Tokyo, I highly recommend checking out Glitch Coffee. While pricey, they are true masters of their craft."

This is literally my first Reddit anything ever, mostly because I can hardly find anything on the Internet about this piece otherwise! I've been doing pour-overs using the Hario V60 for years now, so when I saw this Syphon on Goodwill's auction website, I thought it was really cool, so I bid on it and won it! Later, I ended up trying to research it some more, and all I could really find was from [Hario directly](https://global.hario.com/harios_99-history.html) under their history post, being that it was the more limited edition floral model of the O'Share Syphon. It didn't come with the original burner/stove, so I'm using a more modern one, but whoever owned this Syphon before took amazing care of it, and I'm grateful to have gotten it. It makes a really great cup!Does anyone have the same model or know any more fun facts about it (or what original stove itay have come with)? Thanks all!"

sticking in the hand grinder world, could go with something like a 1Zpresso ZP6? that seems almost live the unimodal / flat burr and gets rave reviews considering i make almost exclusively light roast pourovers etc.

i'm aware you can get better quality output from hand grinders as opposed to electircs in the same price range but i already have a decent hand grinder. i'm wondering how much i'm gonna need to be spending to get substantial increase in grind quality from what i have. i don't mind slightly janky workflows etc. the main thing i'm chasing is grind consistency.

is the zp6 really the way to go? does it grind up there with electric grinders twice it's price?"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1idh057/8_year_review_of_the_baratza_encore,8 year review of the baratza encore,"I've had my Encore for 8 years. It has seen daily use with just about every non-espresso brewing method you can think of (pour over, automatic drip, moka, cold brew, aeropress, etc). I've been able to find a grind size that works great with every brew method I've tried. It has had a few minor problems, but Baratza's incredible customer service has sorted every situation out, offering free parts and useful DIY videos even many years after the warranty ended. Mostly, I've had to replace the top ring burr maybe every other year, which is a job that takes about 2 minutes. I've been consistently impressed with this grinder, and it's easy to see why it has earned its stellar reputation by industry professionals.

Recently, I decided it's finally time to replace it. I'm having issues with coffee not passing through the burrs and excessive fines. A thorough cleaning and new ring burr didn't sort it out this time. I decided rather than reaching out to Baratza again, I'm going to start fresh with a new grinder. I considered a variety of other options, at much higher price points. A lot of those other fancy, sleek grinders have people spilling their customer service nightmares online, with little to no support from the manufacturers (especially after the end of the warranty). I try not to buy things that are designed to used and thrown away. I want to spend my hard-eared money on things that last. That is why I'm replacing my Encore with another Baratza, I'm getting a Virtuoso this time. Thank you, Baratza, for making a quality product and providing excellent support. I look forward to many more years of delicious brews!"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1iasugx/im_done_with_cuisinart,Im done with cuisinart,"I’ve always loved coffee makers with built-in grinders and bean reservoirs for the convenience, and I had a Cuisinart model that worked flawlessly for 8 years. When it eventually gave out, I immediately upgraded to the DGB-800, but unfortunately, it hasn’t been the same quality.

Here are the main issues I encountered with the DGB-800:

Coffee Temperature: The coffee came out extremely hot, with no way to adjust the temperature. While not a dealbreaker, it was a bit inconvenient to wait for it to cool down.

Water Trapping in the Filter Basket: Occasionally, water would get trapped in the filter basket, causing the front of the unit to steam up. This also damaged the printed lettering on the buttons and resulted in about 40% less coffee in the urn.

Weak Coffee: Even with the grind set to “4” and the strength at its highest (3), the coffee was still weak. After some trial and error, I found that adjusting the grind to “6” and strength to “1” was the only way to get decent coffee, but it wasn’t ideal.

Inaccessible Grinder: After the machine started producing weak coffee again, I tried to clean it, but unlike my previous Cuisinart model, the DGB-800 has no accessible chute for cleaning the grinder. This made it impossible to maintain.

Despite regular maintenance, including filter changes and descaling with vinegar, these issues seemed to stem from poor design or build quality, not user error.

Overall, I’m really disappointed with the decline in quality. I’ve always trusted Cuisinart appliances, but this coffee maker just doesn’t live up to the standard I expected. I’ve since replaced it with a similar (and less expensive) model from Gevi, and so far, I’m really happy with the new one.

Just wanted to share my experience—Cuisinart has definitely taken a step back with this model."

So, years ago I started my coffee journey when I was working as a barista for Starbucks while studying at university. We regularly had these coffee tastings where we brewed one of their beans and tried it with different food items. And I remember we had one of the dark roasts and paired it with a savoury sandwich (something with basil pesto) and it was actually quite good. It actually opened my eyes because up until then for me coffee was only something to have with a slice of cake (wasn‘t much of a coffee drinker back then anyway - oh, how the times have changed).

I know, looking back on it now it‘s hilarious what Starbucks considers light or medium roast…

Nowadays I prefer specialty coffee beans (mostly medium roasts) but they are usually more of the fruity/nutty kind that I wouldn‘t pair with something savoury.

So I‘m wondering if you people have some recommendations on good quality coffee that I could use to recreate such pairings? As I‘m from Austria I would prefer European roasters if possible!"

* those perfecting espresso know that changing pressure impacts flow / taste of the output
* posters on aeropress subreddit seem obessed with trying to replicate espresso taste from an aeropress and talk about increasing pressure

But \*in isolation\* what does pressure actually bring to a coffee drink?

I get that in the espresso world the pressure question is optimising things so that the right volume / flow of output comes out in relation to the input mass of coffee, and then triangulated with the flavour / texture of the resulting coffee.  But does the pressure itself affect the taste (or is it impossible to isolate one from another)?

Ditto in the aeropress world if we conclude that pressure in the espresso world is just a ""means to an end"" to achieve the right flow rate, can we conclude that no matter what pressure is achieved in an aeropress, because it is an immersion brewer that the pressure has zero effect whatsoever?"

Interesting. Would not do it all the time, but when I'm at home, it's nice."

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1i21zfi/homemade_alt_milk_an_rd_thread,Homemade alt milk an rd thread,"Hey Reddit Coffee Family,

I've been working in third wave cafes for what feels like most of my life and am used to the delicate steaming that is required to make a proper drink with alternative milks (I have used a LOT of different brands of alt-milk).

I'm working on creating a non dairy, gluten free and crap free alternative milk. It doesn't necessarily have to be JUST oat milk or JUST almond etc it can be a mix, but it has to taste great and steam well.

All of the alternative milks that steam well enough to do latte art seem to include what I would consider ""bad"" oils. I've been looking at recipes for oat milk that use enzymes to modify the proteins which I will be experimenting with soon.

 However, the one road block I keep coming to is the oil. I do not want to use low quality seed oils (and budget is not an issue). I have scoured the group and found lots of great information (I will add the links and recipes that I found useful, feel free to comment with more!).

I have found some recipes that include cashews to make the milk creamier, but it seems like all of the ""homemade"" recipes do not steam as well as Minor Figures or the Oatly barista. I had the idea that perhaps instead of using canola oil, I could try something like cashew oil? Flax oil? Coconut?

If anyone has successfully made an alt-milk that steams as good (or better) than the commercial milks available, or has advice on one that works without any ""crap"" in it (unhealthy seed oils) please chime in!

TLDR: We are hoping to be able to do latte art with a home made healthy dairy alternative milk.

I will post my progress and share when I have results (good or bad).

Hope you're sipping on something GOOD.

Cheers and thank you all for your contribution to this group!

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1i1z0fa/vacuum_chamber_experiments_anyone,Vacuum chamber experiments anyone,"I just got a vacuum chamber sealer and I'm wondering about some applications for coffee.  searching ""vacuum chamber"" here doesn't return much and neither does a wider google search.  So far I've done:

cold brew with a vacuum jump-start then 36 hours in the fridge in the sealed jar.  I've strained one batch, the 20g batch in about 120g water, it was drinkable at full strength, but had basically no character and was muddy.

same thing except 60:120 and 120 seconds of vacuum instead of 40 seconds, is waiting to be strained.  It's obviously darker, but not sure if because of higher ratio, extra vacuum, or both.

Next up I'm going to try 4 minutes and then immediately strain, I predict that should pull out the lighter notes.

I'm also curious about trying this with ethanol instead of water.  It should dissolve a lot more flavors, but would they be good flavors?  One of my goals is a good extract for cocktails so having it be boozy wouldn't matter, especially if I only need like a teaspoon.

Lastly, my wife gets up before me 2x a week and hates the grinder, would pre-grinding and vacuum sealing be significantly better than just pre-grinding into a jar and putting the lid on, or would vacuum sealing pull out a bunch of aromatics and flavor?  Was planning to do this tonight and see.

Anyway, curious if anyone has thoughts, experience, or wants to suggest another experiment for me.  I have a good double boiler espresso machine, an aeropress, a moccamaster drip, and a chemex at my disposal as well as an elektra mignon specialita grinder and a Fellow Opus grinder at my disposal.  My vacuum chamber can take a 8 ounce short jar and about 1/2 - 2/3 full of liquid."

We're using a 500mm graham condensor with a funnel at the top. A fish pump pushes ice water around the coil. Temp drops from near boiling to low 40 degrees. If we brew in a separate device (chemex/aeropress) it takes about 3 passes to get in the low 40's with ice water, but only two passes with salty ice water that we've gotten down to 20f. If we do a single brew and use v60 filters in the cone at the top it gets to low 40s  without the need for extra passes. Coffee tastes really good and we're delighted with how it turned out."

I bought this amazing washed coffee a couple of days ago. Never tried it before.

Had a friend over and got a bit anxious because I normally brew only for one and not for two. But in the I just used the same recipe* as I have used for my standard brew and just scaled it up (340g to 500g).

It was amazing.

It was like drinking strawberry marshmallows. Like candy. One of those brews where you just go ""wow what the hell"".

Then I scaled it down to my standard brew size and it was astringent, boring, probably under extracted, made my mouth dry. So next time I grinded at 1.7 (finer). Over extracted (I think). It was fine but entirely missing all the candy-like notes, not even a hint. Then I dropped the brew temperature to 91c and it was better but still veeeery far from the amazing first brew. And now I upped the grind size a bit and put temp back to 94c. And it is still boring. Slightly astringent. Not a hint of the strawberry explosion in my mouth. Its fine. That's it.

And now I am annoyed and started wondering what is the method You opt for when scaling your brew? And here I am, writing this.

* Hario switch, 1.6 on 1presso jx, 30g beans, 94c water, 30sec bloom with about 40g of water (switch closed), open switch and do one long pour to full weight of 500g. Nothing fancy."

I've been leaning into lighter south American roasts. I've also adopted black coffee as normal consumption, which I never thought I would do. I always used to have to use sugar and cream to hide the real coffee taste.

We make coffee for customers on the whale watching boat I work on. It's not the best (preground drip), but not the worst coffee I've consumed. Over the past couple months, I've been purposely drinking more of the boat coffee. Even going as far as not making my own brew before work. This makes me really appreciate my specialty cups at home on my days off. Even if my home brews aren't perfect, they have been tasting better with respect to the daily work cups.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1hycujy/disrupted_pour_tool_hobo_edition,Disrupted pour tool hobo edition,"Before learning of and eventually buying a Melodrip, which I think is a great tool to have in the toolkit, I wanted to experiment with disrupted pouring/improved showerheads. I was skeptical of my  Moccamaster's showerhead - I felt it's flow was too concentrated with its shower for some roasts/grinds.

After much daydreaming about the problem, I thought to try my toddler's 360 sippy cup, which has perfectly sized holes for gentle water flow. These cups are cheap and readily available at the big retailers. You just pull off the silicone topper thingy to expose the holes. I used it bottom side up. I iterated on this, eventually hacking off one handle and some of what would be the top rim to give it a lower profile. This aided when slipping it under the Moccamaster showerhead.

I've since grown up and moved on to primarily pour over as I realized just how much meddling I was doing in the name of control with a so-called automatic brewer. The lessons are still valuable, nonetheless.

I have a low-end grinder that seems to produce a lot of fines with some roasts so being able to use a low agitation pouring aid can really help when I can't quite avoid overextraction when dialing in a bean. Shout out to Aramse's pouring pro video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxmrSgwW25g) for some great visuals if you are new to these concepts.

 \- Any reason I shouldn't pre-mix the two solutions in my preferred ratio. I know I won't be able to alternate between different recipes/ratios, but assuming I'm okay with just the one.

Thanks"

A proper way would be to use micron (100-600um) sieves and weigh each size fraction to determine how ""good"" your grinder is at producing a consistent size fraction. I just took a photo.

So brief background:

I'm a geologist so I know nothing about coffee, but do know a bit about sample splitting, grind size, extraction method, etc. in mineral/ore samples.

If good coffee is about extracting the right compounds at the right rate then grind size (along with beans, temperature and time) will be one of the most controlling factors. Consistent grind size should ensure consistent interaction between solvent (water) and solute (coffee). Finer grind will lead to over extraction of solutes and coarser grind will inhibit solvent reaction between the water and desired solutes.

My cheap breville grinder seems to do a pretty bad job at consistently grinding to a set size. Particle size varies wildly and ""dialing in"" was settling on a sour shot at #17 or a bitter shot at #18. I have a new grinder on order and will do this exercise again to see how it compares.

So ... to make the ""perfect"" espresso do we need a good grinder or do we need any grinder and a good set of sieves to isolate a size fraction?

Linked is images from ""click"" 6 to 21 on a sunbeam Em0440 grinder. Have a KingrindK6 arriving soon and will compare when it arrives.

With that in mind, let me ask: is there a “sweet spot” in price range for solid, higher end coffee beans? Like a point where any less, the quality is noticeably lower, but any higher you start to see diminishing returns on your investment? What is generally considered a normal price for the good stuff?

Maybe that number doesn’t exist. I know bourbon and beer pretty well at this point; for 50-60 bucks I can get wonderful bourbon that I enjoy immensely. It’s noticeably better than lower priced stuff, but even if I might like a 100 dollar bottle slightly more, it’s not worth the extra price.

Does coffee have that same dichotomy?"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1hvtpat/ww_the_key_grinder_issues,Ww the key grinder issues,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to ask for your experiences with the Weber Workshops “The Key” grinder. I’ve had my model for a few days now and have ground around 500g of beans so far. To be honest, the shots just taste bad. Sour shots, no matter the extraction time. But it’s not the kind of strong acidity you’d get from incorrect extraction times—it’s more of a subtle sourness in the aftertaste. This is with a bean that’s on the darker side and doesn’t have any acidity to begin with.

Now the question is: does the grinder simply need proper seasoning? If yes, does the taste really improve that drastically? I’m familiar with seasoning other grinders, where you might get a 10–20% improvement in flavor, but in my case, the Key would need to pull off a complete 180° turnaround. The shots in their current state are just not enjoyable.

I’m curious if this was also the case for you when using the Key without seasoning and if I’m worrying unnecessarily here. Regardless, I plan to buy some beans in the coming days, grind around 5kg through it, and then reassess.

**P.S.** One thing I forgot to mention: The grind I’m currently getting always looks as if it’s too coarse because there are a few boulders that make the overall grind appear coarser than it actually is. For comparison, I also have a Niche Zero, and this doesn’t happen with it. So, it seems that the grind from the Key at this point isn’t really uniform."

A decent moka pot
Something to heat in
Something to drink from

Step 2: Fill the funnel exactly 1/3 way in, I use 3 spoons for my full container, only 1 for this pour over (leaves brewing space)

Step 3: Cold water blooming to set up filtration system (u cam use aeropress)

Step 4: use moka pot valve to estimate the ratio (around 1:12 of 1/3rd of the container [do ur own maths for better results])

Step 5: shift to drinking device as a measure for yeild

Step 6: heat till lil near boiling

Step 7: Shift to moka pot collector part

Step 8; pour over,  spiral pattern

Step 9: admire

Step 10: pour out and  drink [it's good enough]

Inferences

metal filters have some good heat conducting properties which helps with it, so does the design of the funnel and the bottom container

It let s  in a lot of oils I comparison to a v60 or chemex

A slightly stronger brew as u have to pour more often

It amplifies the notes
Things to keep in mind:

maintain the temp in the kettle

Make sure the grounds are leveled in and not stuck to the wall when pouring in

If not using aeropress filter, try to disturb it as little as possible to not f up the filtration
System

Drawback : lil about of grounds, low yeild"

My wife suggested there might be different roasting traditions in the countries. I think there may be some cultural meme that was established when different colonial powers got their coffee from different regions of the world, but doesn't really apply any more.

I reached out to them to let them know, and they were responsive, explaining the quality control measures they have in place and acknowledging that, while rare, things like this can occasionally slip through during processing.

It got me thinking: What should a roaster do in situations like this to maintain trust and customer satisfaction?

I don’t expect perfection from any company- mistakes and mishaps happen. But I also feel that finding foreign material in a product like coffee could be concerning for some customers. Should roasters offer a replacement bag, a refund, or maybe a discount on a future purchase? Or is a heartfelt apology and acknowledgement enough?

For context, I didn’t ask for compensation, and I’m happy with how the roaster responded. They were professional and thoughtful, which left a good impression. But I’d love to hear the community’s thoughts. How should roasters handle situations like this (to you roasters out there), and what would you expect as a customer?"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1hn53o5/opening_a_coffee_house_does_this_plan_make_sense,Opening a coffee house does this plan make sense,"Sorry for the long-ish post.

I've done a ton of research and I know there will be a lot of ""don't do it"" comments.  It's kind of why I'm here though as I'm trying to decide if my plan makes sense enough to give it a go.

As a background, I'm a 47 year old healthcare worker who has burnt out from that job after 24 years.  I need a change from illness and death.

I'm a frequent world traveller and rather unintentionally ended up visiting many of the top coffee producing countries in the world. I'm not big on trust attractions though, and I always make cafes and coffee houses a daily ritual during travel.

So I've experienced thousands of them and have always planned out what I felt was good or bad in them, as well as what made some special.

I currently have some freedom from my job and have time to look at a career change before I decide if I go back or not.   I'm fortunate to have financial backing of some doctor friends who are looking for investment opportunities and like this idea.

I'm in a smallish white collar city of about 65000 with 105000 if you include the commuters from outside city limits.

It's always been underserved in terms of quality coffee places.  There's a couple Starbucks in the mall areas and 2 places in the downtown that I'd consider competition.  One of which does their own roasting, the other sources from a local roaster

Obviously, there's a need to provide something unique to succeed.

There's a few things I feel could set mine apart.
1- nothing in the downtown is open past 430-5pm.
2- Starbucks has moved away from seating altogether to be grab amd go.
3- the city has become quite multicultural and nobody is catering to that demographic.

My proposal is to open a coffee house and roastery. A place open until 10 or 11 in the downtown restaurant area.  High quality coffee, tea, grab and go food and a good dessert selection. Building a daytime business and foot traffic clientele and the evening time after dinner/dating/study or working types.

Additionally, I'd include more international coffee styles in the menu like Turkish, Vietnamese and a few others.  Loose leaf tea options as well.

I've considered starting out by working on the roasting side and maybe getting a larger home roaster or small commercial one to work with, while also practicing the needed barista skills and recipes.

The next step might be a coffee truck.  The area lacks a coffee truck in the rotation and there's always festival, sports tournaments and other things asking for trucks to set up at events.  I think a daily rotation between the many office buildings would generate solid sales too.

This is a lower investment for startup and lower overhead option to get experience.  If it goes well, then I could consider opening the brick and mortar version.

Does this seem like a logical plan going into it?  Any advice?"

Related - is anyone else disappointed with the Moccamaster?  I have the KBGV For being arguably the defacto high end drip brewer, I find it kinda meh.  It makes a good cup of coffee and I appreciate that the company has excellent service.  I also think it looks cool.  However I found these shortcomings:

* While brewing, the shower head doesn't cover most of the beans, potentially leading to uneven extraction.  I've read that some people (and will myself) open the basket and stir the slurry while brewing, but that's the whole point of a drip brewer.
 Otherwise I could just make a pour over.

* After 3-4 years, the plastic carafe lid is broken.  Good news is that I can buy a new one.

* The plastic parts aren't dishwasher safe.

* The drip stop drips and always has.

I never really understood why, until recently, when I read more about water for coffee, I realised Hong Kong’s water’s is far lower than SCA standard.  Which kind of explains why Hong Kong’s coffee’s acidity in general is pretty sharp and the body is quite flat.

I suspect the reason they add egg shell (which is a great source of calcium carbonate) to water, where the CO2 would dissolve the calcium carbonate to calcium bicarbonate..

Which raises the mineral content (and a little bit of buffer) , which gives it a bit more body and sweetness…theoretically.

Steeping my water with eggs shells now and will report back 🤣"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1hf1hi7/question_about_the_grinding_rule_regarding,Question about the grinding rule regarding,"**Question about the grinding rule regarding different brewing methods**

I recently received a French press as a gift and, when I came across some videos on the internet about the brewing method, I almost naturally watched James Hoffmann's video on his French Press method - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st571DYYTR8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st571DYYTR8). In it, and also in one of his videos where he compares immersion and percolation methods - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09fNvoQMlGw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09fNvoQMlGw), I found a point quite intriguing, which ended up being a complete turnabout of everything I knew about brewing methods depending on the grind size.

Here’s the point: classically, it is known that the faster the water passes through the coffee, the finer the grind should be – meaning that to compensate for the short contact time, the contact area is increased. However, James recommends that the grind for the French Press should not be that coarse, and in his method, the water stays in contact with the coffee even longer. In my mind, the logic would be to have an over-extracted, bitter coffee, but that’s not what happened in the video or in real life when I started using the French Press: I really liked the results.

And here’s where it gets complicated: why, in an immersion method, doesn’t it seem to make such a difference to use a finer grind, compared to pour-over? For example, I’ve used a fine grind in my V60 and the result was disastrous: bitter, over-extracted coffee.

Does this have to do with the saturation point of the water, the extraction? If so, how does that work? What’s the explanation for why coffee with a finer grind (and by ""finer,"" I don’t mean espresso grind, but rather medium grind, maybe a bit finer than the typical medium grind) ends up tasting horrible in a pour-over, but in the French Press, where the water stays in contact with the coffee even longer, this doesn’t make much of a difference?

James Hoffmann’s comparison video about immersion and percolation methods is very telling on this: how can the immersion method perform so much more evenly better, regardless of the grind size? What other factors for a good coffee am I ignoring that would help me understand this?

A big thank you to all the coffee nerds!!"

So my brother managed to buy a MELITTA AROMA ART-Coffeemachine somewhere.

It is meant as a gift for someone else, but sadly, the Cap (i guess the one ontop of the Glass-Jug)

is missing. He came up with the idea, that we could re-make the cap with a 3d-printer.
But for that, we need to know the dimensions of the cap.

Does someone own a MELITTA AROMA ART can can give me the dimensions please?
Here is a picture for reference, so that you know, which Coffee Machine i mean.

2. Makes it taste awful/loses taste

So in the last few months, after a friend of mine gave me his aeropress, I've been exploring with coffee more intensely than ever before. After discovering James Hoffmann, buying a moka pot, using my buddies chemex and learning more about these different brewing methods, I've really gone off on a journey of experimentation.

This entire time I had always been searching for that 'perfect' brewing method. I was looking for a non acidic or too bitter cup that gets out all the flavors of the bean and presents it in the clearest way possible. But today, after using my moka pot after an aero press, I had a totally different experience with both that were equally pleasant. I realized that using different brewing methods creates a different drink altogether, so my thinking has kind of been wrong all along.

I realized that the French press, the aeropress, the chemex, and the moka pot all make fairly different drinks and that one is not necessarily better than the other, which is kind of freeing because I like all of them for different reasons."

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1h92khu/how_cold_is_too_cold_for_hot_coffee,How cold is too cold for hot coffee,"**TL;DR**: At what temperature do you find hot coffee no longer appetizing or drinkable?

I'm a slow coffee drinker who likes to sip coffee throughout the day. Even at home I often take an hour or more to finish a mug. I’ve used an Ember Mug, which I love for keeping coffee at a consistent temperature, but the battery doesn’t last long enough, and once it’s off, the coffee gets cold FAST.

I recently bought a new travel mug (Zojirushi) to replace my old BrüMate and decided to test their temperature retention. The test is currently ongoing:

* I boiled water, poured it into both mugs, and tracked the temperature over several hours.
* I didn’t preheat the mugs and recorded the first temperature after one minute, then once every hour.

Here’s the data I got:

https://preview.redd.it/2gaw33mm0n5e1.png?width=1254&format=png&auto=webp&s=878247b5322d98293112df0eab8f2640a75a761f

I stopped testing at this point, but running the data into a regression calculator found that the Zijirushi would have needed another 7-8 hours to go from 140º down to 120º.

With the Ember, I’ve found my ideal drinking temperature is between **132-140°F**. Below that, I find it gross, unless it’s a latte with oat milk as I can tolerate it. though I have no issue sipping cold brew all day as long as there is no dairy creamer in it.

What’s your “too cold to drink” temperature for hot coffee?"

Here are some specific questions I have:

1. Should I start by working with a broker? If so, where can I find trustworthy brokers?
2. Is it better to go through an importer? If yes, how do I find reliable ones?
3. Would it make sense to sell directly to roasters? If so, how can I connect with roasters who might be interested in my coffee?

If anyone here has experience in this area or can share advice, I’d really appreciate it! I’m even happy to pay with coffee if you can offer some helpful guidance"

I was gifted a  Ode grinder, and while it works fine, it produces an annoying DC humming noise that significantly impacts the user experience. I reached out to Fellow, hoping for support.

Despite explaining the situation and providing proof that it was a gift, they refused to offer a repair, inspection, or replacement because the grinder was purchased outside the U.S. (and not directly from them). Instead, they assured me that the noise was “normal” (despite it not being present in all units) and offered a 10% discount code for future purchases—a gesture that feels hollow given the circumstances.

For a premium product like the Ode, I expected better accountability and customer service from Fellow. Their unwillingness to stand behind their product, regardless of the point of purchase, is disappointing.

Has anyone else encountered this issue? Were you able to fix or mitigate the humming noise? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I moved and with my new setup I cannot even make a cup of coffee anymore. It sputters and struggles to come out, but it also seems to hot because the bit of coffee that comes out starts boiling too as I wait minutes for it to trickle and spurt out.

These are the variables that have changed:
- have a no-brand moka pot I bought at a random store
- use an electric hob instead of a gas flame. I keep it at a 3 or 4 but I turned it up when it’s not coming smoothly. I pre boil the water so it shouldn’t take as long.
- bought a medium-roast coffee that I asked the shop to grind to moka pot size but it’s definitely espresso-sized granules

I’m thinking it’s a combination between the coffee being ground too fine and the gasket of this no-name moka pot not being made well — perhaps the holes are too small to let the coffee through easily.

Is there anything else I should try before switching moka pot and coffee? Any general advice for an electric hob? Really don’t like it compared to a gas stove."

I thought it would be a simple and fun project, but of course, that's never the case. I had some big plans, but I can't even get the machine to work normally.

When I power it on, the solenoid valve opens, and water from the mains flows into the boiler. Unfortunately, the boiler overflows, and water comes out of the vacuum valve and the pressure release valve.

I have tested and inspected the SM probe and found no issues. Any ideas on where to troubleshoot next?

I'm guessing the Gicar box needs to be replaced, which isn't ideal as I've only found one place that sells it. I was also told by the company that the control box is a special part and made to order, which takes a long time. Ideally, I'd like to fix the issue rather than buying a new box.

Any help would be great as I havnt found much information about my machine and the Gicar box, thanks in advance.

Working parts:

The solenoid valve fills the boiler when the machine is turned on.
The pump engages when the lever is pulled up to 90 degrees, and water comes out of the group.
The solenoid valve opens at 75 degrees and lets mains water in without using the pump.
The solenoid valve depressurizes at 180 degrees after the pump is used.
The heating element and pressure stat work.

Non-working parts:

The SM probe relay is not working and doesn't turn off the solenoid valve.

I'm just wondering what you think of idea - if there would be a social platform, that could connect producers, distributors, roasters and consumers in one place? Something like LinkedIn just for coffee people.

There would be an option to make regular or business profile for people to find partners, search for coffee or equipment all around the world and find what suits you best.

In my mind this idea sounds wonderful, because I see how it could help people and open so many opportunities to them.

Could you share your thoughts on it and maybe inform me if there's already one, because I could'nt find.

Thanks in advance!"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1gv437z/the_great_midnight_roast_hoax,The great midnight roast hoax,"I’m a long time Dunkin’ Donuts drinker for many years now I know what I like and I know what I don’t like. years ago there was a dark roast option that I really liked and preferred over the original blend to the point where I actually don’t like the original blend anymore, I can’t stand it. Later on midnight replaces dark roast as the dark roast option I guess as a branding thing. I’m not certain I tasted a huge difference, but I do like midnight also, and now when I drink Dunkin every day, I drink midnight. So a couple of months ago it was brought to my attention that when I order midnight roast coffee about 90% of the time, I’m not actually getting it. Let me fill you in on a little bit of backstory.

I used to work a job overnight driving through neighborhoods and at 5 AM one specific location of Dunkin’ Donuts is where I ended up every night because they opened at five am. I use the mobile app to make my order and when I get there, I drive-through and pick up my order. I emphasize I’ve been going to Dunkin’ Donuts for many years in the morning at my old job, and at this overnight job and even in my old neighborhood, stores would see my face. It was not uncommon that Dunkin’ Donuts staff would recognize me and memorize my orders. As soon as they see my face they start working on it. That’s how much I went and my order has always been pretty simple. I drink, black coffee and the only variations on that I’ve ever had is if I put a little sugar in it or hazelnut flavor and that’s it.  If I get food or not depends,…but about three or four different Dunkin’ Donuts locations in my lifetime have memorized me by face by order. So this particular location always had midnight brewing for me specifically and they were very nice and they always made it a point to say we are brewing this just for you. I guess as if not many people order it which is what I assumed originally anyway, but I never understood why they needed to emphasize that they are brewing midnight ready just for me.

So this overnight job that I had got to a point where I started to not feel the jolt of my midnight coffee so I started adding an espresso shot to it and I’m not an espresso drinker, but I did feel the jolt after that, and unfortunately, I start using this method to keep up energy so now I can literally taste the difference between midnight coffee, original blend, and midnight coffee with an espresso shot in it. I know the taste and I know the difference because I don’t put milk in it or too much sugar or anything like that, and sometimes when people burn coffee that could happen too and the taste is weird. As time went on I realized espresso is not for me. I don’t like the way it makes me feel, I feel like I started to develop heart palpitations after I introduced it to my diet. One thing that I did notice, though was depending on who was working in the store, the quality of the coffee would be different so during the weekdays the staff that had the midnight coffee ready for me the coffee was perfect and on the weekend because I worked literally every day the coffee tasted funny. Either it was watered down or just tasted like a weird version of the espresso so I ended up taking a break from coffee because I did not like how my body was reacting to it.
I reset my body, got rest change my schedule, and started back on coffee again.
So a couple of months ago it was brought to my attention after ordering my go to coffee from a completely different store that when I order midnight black with hazelnut flavor, what the staff is doing is taking original blend and then they heat up some espresso…pour it in there and stir it up and if I hadnt happened to catch this as it was happening, I probably would never know that 99% of the time this is how Dunkin’ Donuts stores all over the place are making midnight blend when you ask for midnight.

They’re giving you original and they’re putting espresso in it and then mixing it up and calling it the midnight brew. And being somebody that doesn’t like the taste of the original blend I wasn’t happy about this and actually kind of pissed me off because, it explained so much of the difference in quality between the times that I ordered it with people that are looking out for me apparently and everybody else who’s doing this by the numbers technique that seems to be a mainstay within the Dunkin’ Donuts stores.  They must do it to save money.

So not intentionally but I went on to further prove this fact. I’ve since visited about five or six stores and sadly they all do it and I order my order inside the store now and watch them pour original blend and mix it with an espresso shot when I’m asking for Midnight brew.

Listen, if that’s what it is then just say that, but if I’m asking for a specific thing then just say that you don’t have it or you don’t want todo it and this is what we want give you in return.  I personally don’t want drink espresso specifically.  I also specifically don’t like the taste of the original blend that’s two things. I actually do like how the midnight brew comes out when it’s brewed. So now when I order Dunkin I go inside. I watch them do the wrong thing and I asked them kindly: “Hey is it possible you can just brew a bag of the midnight for me? I have no problem waiting for it”.  When I pointed out like that every time they all seem to reset and say oh, and then they have some excuse about how it’s the same thing. And to be fair even if they could articulate it I’m personally not interested in whatever the reason is, I don’t want to drink it. I want to drink a brewed pot of midnight. I don’t want to  drink a mixture of two different things if that’s possible.  If it’s not possible then just say so. But I don’t like this because again, I was staying away from espresso. I thought I was, but apparently I’ve been drinking it the whole time so I don’t know who likes midnight and maybe I’m the only person on earth that asked for midnight but at Dunkin,  unless you asked for them to brew a pot, there’s a  99% chance that they’re not brewing it at all and they’re giving you something else and yes, I can taste the difference."

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1gtr5d7/buying_fruity_coffee_is_so_hit_or_miss,Buying fruity coffee is so hit or miss,"Every time I buy coffee I buy from the same roaster who let's you choose your beans and your roast and then they roast them just for you.

About every 3rd bag of Ethiopian light roasted coffee will turn out to have at least a little bit of berry-like flavor but in between I get bags that are ""just coffee"" - medi-ocre, boring, and I can't really taste fruity notes.

I can't tell if the roaster is messing up or if it's just the particular batch of beans they have right now. Sometimes when I order light roast it arrives looking a little more medium. I'd think there should still be hints of fruity flavor even at medium roast.

How long does light roasted fruity coffee usually need to rest after roasting to develop its flavor and how quickly do those notes fade?

I recently had some I didn't get to drink until about 2 or 2.5 months after it was roasted and it still had a nice subtle fruity flavor even after sitting all that time.

Do any roasteries actually nail their tasting notes > 90% of the time? I sure haven't found that to be the case.

**Edit:** I always buy natural processed coffee and brew it with an Aeropress."
https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1gtntz7/aeropress_question_compacted_grounds,Aeropress question compacted grounds,"Hi all,

love this sub and really appreciate the recipes and conversation on this sub.

I've searched everywhere and I only get results about why letting the water drain all the through, compacting the grounds, is bad. but that’s due more to gravity with a paper filter running up the sides affecting the extraction. I’m familiar with that. But I had the same question for aeropress.

With an aeropress the sides are non-permeable and part of the process is forcing the water through with the press. So my question is what happens/how does it extract if you let all the water drain through and the grounds compact on itself. What happens when you put more water and press? And what happens to the grounds sitting in residual hot water in the time that you left it between pours?

Thanks in advance! I try not post questions that might’ve been answered or have easy answers. So apologies if this is found somewhere but I really couldn’t find an answer for this anywhere. If anyone has any sources on the science of aeropress extraction so I might not have to post again, thanks!"

I do want do be able to brew a regular V60 and was wondering if the switch is really able to brew like a regular V60, since the flow rate would probably be somewhat impeded by the ball valve.

I guess what I am asking is, if the switch is really as good/flexible of a device as everyone claims it to be, how come it is not common to see someone owning one or using them in competitions etc."
